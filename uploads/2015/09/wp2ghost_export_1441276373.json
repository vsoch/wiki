However, many small donations, thanks to his website, proved him wrong. Currently, it seems to me that running for President requires a higher financial status. With the ability to draw people in, collect donations, and generally spend less doing so, the internet will allow for individuals with less financial means to run. In 2004, the Kerry and Bush campaigns spent $1 on web campaigning for every $100 they spent on TV campaigning (Pew Internet and American Life Project).

The present issues concerning the implementation of a city wide wireless system are debatable. However, they wane in comparison to the larger implications of a \u201cWireless Philadelphia,\u201d\u009d which are both curious and frightening.\n\nI think that this project fundamentally is an effort for the government to exert control. EarthLink, the ISP of choice because of its liberal views, will have a monopoly over Philadelphia, as Google will have over San Francisco (K.Rogerson). As Ken Rogerson pointed out, the network will be \u201cmaintained\u201d\u009d by a non profit agency, also known as the government. This liaison brings up issues of privacy. It seems to me that one of the main incentives for the government to subsidize this project is a long term promise of information, as in the long run the internet will continue encompassing a larger part of our financial, personal, and communicative lives. This cause seemingly geared towards education and betterment of the community is actually an effort to put a leash on a universe that supports direct democracy over represented democracy.\n\nAdditionally, a city completely controlled by one ISP would allow this ISP to control the internet space of consumers, possibly leading to a more \u201cgeographically bordered\u201d\u009d web experience, as Michael Geist alluded to in his article. Could this control be used to unify Philadelphia as community? I think it might allow for specified advertising and stricter access rules, but I do not see a common ISP as uniting a community, as the internet historically has broken the boundaries of location.\n\nNow I would like to discuss the scary part of having a government controlled city-wide network. The first part isn\u2019t so scary. This sort of system might easily transition into connecting a citizen to his or her school, the grocery store, the postal system, and other services of the town. A citizen may be registered on the wireless network as being a member of the town, and could apply this registration with the swipe of a card, such as driver\u2019s license. With wireless across the city and possibly the nation, the nonprofit (government) might be able to monitor every citizen\u2019s transaction, movement, and personal information.

It seems to me that having internet access is useless if individuals do not have computers or a good education.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Philadelphia is going wireless. The present issues concerning the implementation of a city wide wireless system are debatable. However, they wane in comparison to the larger implications of a &#8220;Wireless Philadelphia,&#8221;\u009d which are both curious and frightening.<\/p>\n<p>I think that this project fundamentally is an effort for the government to exert control. EarthLink, the ISP of choice because of its liberal views, will have a monopoly over Philadelphia, as Google will have over San Francisco (K.Rogerson). As Ken Rogerson pointed out, the network will be &#8220;maintained&#8221;\u009d by a non profit agency, also known as the government. This liaison brings up issues of privacy. It seems to me that one of the main incentives for the government to subsidize this project is a long term promise of information, as in the long run the internet will continue encompassing a larger part of our financial, personal, and communicative lives. This cause seemingly geared towards education and betterment of the community is actually an effort to put a leash on a universe that supports direct democracy over represented democracy.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, a city completely controlled by one ISP would allow this ISP to control the internet space of consumers, possibly leading to a more &#8220;geographically bordered&#8221;\u009d web experience, as Michael Geist alluded to in his article. Could this control be used to unify Philadelphia as community? I think it might allow for specified advertising and stricter access rules, but I do not see a common ISP as uniting a community, as the internet historically has broken the boundaries of location.<\/p>\n<p>Now I would like to discuss the scary part of having a government controlled city-wide network. The first part isn&#8217;t so scary. This sort of system might easily transition into connecting a citizen to his or her school, the grocery store, the postal system, and other services of the town.

The hairy beastie that comes into the equation is the environment, but as humans we are still in control of our reactions to that environment. In stating this I start to think of neurobiology and correlating neurotransmitters and electrical firing to behavior and personality, suggesting that we are less ghost and more machine, but for the sake of the phenomenological viewpoint I will stick to the beautiful idea of free will.\n\nCarl Rogers came up with this phenomenological viewpoint, and in it he also discusses a subconscious guide called the \u201corganismic valuing process,\u201d\u009d or a tendency to draw us towards experience that allow us to grow, and away from experiences and people that inhibit growth. This sounds like gut feeling to me, and I think that in a society that idealizes certain qualities and experiences that may be true to some and not others, there is a higher risk of forcing oneself into experiences that go against gut feeling, and consequently inhibit growth. The voice of what is socially acceptable and prized seems to be stronger than the intuitive, inner voice that guides the individual towards self realization.\n\nI agree with Rogers that our perceptions of our selves are most important in leading to self actualizing and happiness, but I wonder about whether it is my perception of myself that is most important, or how I perceive others to perceive me. I say this because there are aspects of myself for which the ideal self and actual self are correlated, but I might think that other people look down on this characteristic, despite me valuing it. I think that Rogers theory probably takes this sort of social influence into account in the idea that the ideal self is influenced by society, but I question whether the Q-sort can correctly account for stubbornness on the individual\u2019s part in having a trait that they perceive as valuable and matching up with their ideal self, but feeling judged in the eyes of society. I think there should be three measures taken for assessment: a measure of ideal self, a measure of actual self, and a measure of what the individual thinks that people perceive them to be. I might guess that people who differ widely between how they actually are and how they think they are perceived might be more psychologically troubled because they are either working hard to maintain a false image or are unable to relate their true selves to others, or feel that their true self is not appreciated by others. For example, I see myself as highly ethical, and value that characteristic, but I know that many behaviors that I don\u2019t engage in as a result of this quality are not judged highly by my peer group. It might not even be that they judge it poorly, but that their behavior reflects a large difference between our expressions of that characteristic, which makes me question it. Even if many might value this characteristic, what matters is my observation of my peers\u2019 behavior, my judgment of their level of this characteristic, and then the conclusion that the large difference means that I must be judged poorly by them. In a sense, this is jumping to concussions, but I feel very strongly that the idea that we look at ourselves through the eyes of other people should be further explored. A society that verbally promotes individuality but leads to and an unspoken lemming dynamic can certainly play tricks on the individual\u2019s psychological health.\n\nIt might be beneficial to ask how humans developed this dynamic from a phenomenological viewpoint. All organisms have a need to be appreciated, loved, and valued, first from others, and then from themselves. If an individual perceives having a quality about himself or herself as a bad thing, that he or she might only be valued in absence of a certain quality or in the presence of one that is lacked, then this might lead to a conditioned sense of positive regard. Put in simpler terms, I am told that being valued by society is dependent on having factors x and y and not z, and consequently I am alienated from my true self and\/or learn to not trust my feelings. Either way, these conditions of worth make one move away from his or her true self, and in the presence of expectation and internal (possibly unconscious feelings of lacking or defiance), anxiety is born. This anxiety seems to be what differentiates a fully functioning person that is in touch with his or her true self from a maladjusted person. The maladjusted person is either driven to conformity despite straying from their actual selves, which I would argue is the type of person that makes up the majority of society, or caught between a rock and a hard place, unable to meet the conditions of worth, anxious and seeking positive regard, but still trusting gut feelings and unable or unwilling to conform. It is only those individuals whose qualities match up with the expectations of society who never perceive conditions of worth and are allowed to pursue their ideal selves with full support. For everyone else, finding coping strategies to deal with this anxiety while maintaining outward composure is the challenge of being human.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about Rogers phenomenological viewpoint and the idea of actual versus ideal self, and of course have some thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>I have an appreciation for the phenomenological viewpoint because it imbues the individual with free will and states that human beings are all inherently good and striving towards their actual selves, or full potential.

This anticipation is not possible without replication.\n\n**Individuality:** people just differ in construction of events, it\u2019s what makes everyone different.\n\n**Organization:** the construction system is built around relationships between constructs\n\n**Dichotomy: **Our construction system is based upon a finite number of dichotomous constructs. We look at people and situations and characterize them, but there has to be a spectrum, I can\u2019t understand something if I don\u2019t understand it\u2019s opposite. I can\u2019t understand good without having a knowledge of bad, safety doesn\u2019t make sense without it\u2019s opposite danger, etc :and going off of this idea, I would say that most people take the safe route and just stick with the constructs they already have, which I guess you might call being narrow minded or unable to be empathetic, but it makes them less likely, i would speculate, to be able to connect with other people that have different constructs (look at the world in a different way) And then I would also say that people who have an idea of a concept but DON\u2019T understand the level of the opposite either 1. take the idea and applications of it for granted (good health, a good friend) or 2. become stuck in a one minded perception in that when the opposite DOES come along they might negate its value (oh, that\u2019s not very important) or just apply the dominance of their end of the spectrum and make value statements (well, that person just needs to be happy , why wouldn\u2019t he?\n\n**Choice: **I can be safe and look at something with my established construct system, or take a chance and try to apply a new construct, the choice corollary is trying to look at the world in a different way. It\u2019s a risk, of course, but I think that people who take the risk have a more developed, complex system of constructs than those who opt for the safe route.\n\n**Range:** every construct has an appropriate range it can be applied to. Every construct doesn\u2019t apply in every situation\n\n**Experience**: corollary says that my construct system varies as I successfully\/unsuccessfully construe the replication of events.\n\n**Modulation: **some constructs are more plastic\/malleable\/changeable than others.\n\n**Fragmentation **corollary says that because these constructs are in constant change, there is the possibility for inconsistent behavior\n\n**Commonality: **similar construct systems = similar personalities (the idea that \u201cwow, we see the world in such a similar way!! I feel you!!\u201d)\n\n**Sociality: **(the most interesting, in my opinion) to the extent that one person can construe the construction process of another person, he may play a role in social processes involving the other person. So I have to understand someone else\u2019s construction in order to have an interaction with them, and the role I play is dependent on how I understand the other person to perceive me, or how the other person construes my role should be. (Man, this just feels so real, that people, (that I) act, based on how I think others expect or want me to, and me being able to do that requires that I understand the person on a non-superficial level. And of course this isn\u2019t all or nothing, I can see sharing some constructs with another person and enough so that personalities are similar, but not all.\n\nFor example, in my daily speculation I was thinking about the idea of affection, on an emotional and a physical level, and I realize that I\u2019m pretty one sided. I don\u2019t have an understanding of emotionally caring for someone else, not to say that I am incapable of it, but it\u2019s in its infancy. My way of showing emotional support is to make you feel good with buying you things, baking you cakes, giving you cards, and sharing things like quotes, music, and ideas that have made me feel better when I am down, but I have a hard time willingly putting myself in the emotional shoes of another person, and trying to actually live his or her experience to understand it.\n\nBut why Vanessa, why?!? Well I can easily say that in my family, there is a lot of physical affection: hugs, doing nice things for each other that might make them feel better, but there isn\u2019t a lot of venturing into the \u201cI felt this way when you did this: do you understand?\u201d That and I\u2019m the youngest, which has always placed me at the receiving end of all types of affection, and less so at the giving end. So that has made me weaker on the emotional affection side, and leaning heavily on valuing physical affection. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand it or feel it, but that I don\u2019t know how to express it or deal with it in relation to other people.\n\nHere\u2019s the frustration, I can\u2019t express the best way I know how to give affection, physically, with most people outside of family and the rare occurrence of a boyfriend. It\u2019s sort of a contradiction, and I can see how being unable to make a friend or someone I care about feel better might make me distant, or even worse, just seeming like I don\u2019t care. It isn\u2019t socially acceptable, outside of an intimate physical relationship, to express affection through kisses, or touch, or hugging and gazing into eyes and hoping for the life of me that the emotions that I feel and want to express and share somehow are transferred physically. I\u2019m not saying that I WANT to express physical affection towards everyone, I don\u2019t, but I sure as heck need to work on expressing emotional affection a lot more than I do, because no, bonking heads with someone does not imbue them with the strong things I feel and want to share, and sending a card or baking a cake can only go so far. I\u2019m limited to being able to listen to someone, share things that have made me feel better, and give relentlessly, and hope that said person feels better.\n\nThe implications of this? I\u2019ll have no problem expressing physical affection in a relationship, but I\u2019ll have trouble with friendships. And then when you think about the construct system, that people who have similar constructs have similar personalities and therefore \u201cunderstand\u201d one another (which arguably leads to a good friendship, no?) and this last social corollary, that we act based on what we perceive others to expect of us, well when I am in need of affection, I\u2019m pretty sure that my friends won\u2019t know how to give it to me, and that sucks on their side. When my friends need support and my limited strategies don\u2019t work, I\u2019m not going to know what else to do other than backing off and giving them space, and hoping that he or she can resolve things in absence of me.\n\nBut all that said, it\u2019s very reassuring that this system is so open for change, and growth. And one thing I do know about myself, that gives me the ability to understand the thinking of a lot of different types of people, is that I am cognitively complex. It basically means that I take chances on my own constructs and try out different ones all the time, and it leads to a larger range of constructs, and consequently an easier ability reading other people. And a higher level of cognitively complexity = a better ability to predict other people\u2019s behavior and reactions. I might not be able to directly read your mind, but by understanding your thinking, I can predict your behavior and what you might be feeling and thinking.\n\nAgain, for me it\u2019s all about figuring these things out, seeing a dynamic that someone else might not be able to see because they aren\u2019t open to it or it hasn\u2019t even crossed their mind, and then sharing that with them. But it\u2019s hard to the extent that not everyone values emotional insight, for some the emphasis is on academia, or achievement, or career success, or living up to expectations, or material things, (or maybe just not thinking about what they value much at all, and just striving towards some future moment) to the extent that I value wisdom.\n\nI know I\u2019ll always struggle with the idea or knowledge that I can understand a person on a deeper level than they know, but I\u2019m unable to have a conversation with said person about this either because they aren\u2019t open to those sort of ideas, or maybe I perceive them to be less cognitively complex, or pure and naive so that I can\u2019t open up to them because he or she isn\u2019t ready for the opening of that Pandora\u2019s box..\n\nEither way, our society still really struggles with valuing wisdom, on so many levels. It\u2019s just a lot harder to be a feeler than a thinker and a doer, for which you see measurable sources of success- and that looks really great at an institution like Duke. Then it becomes about being able to accept yourself, maybe re-evaluate your idea of \u201csuccess,\u201d and accept that there is a discrepancy between what you value (and when I say YOU I mean I) and what society values , but that\u2019s a whole other can of worms, to be prodded at another day.\n\n\n","html":"<p>This is the way that it usually works, when I want to express what I&#8217;m thinking: when it rains, it pours!

So we like people not based on the favors they do for us, but what we do for them.\n\nI think it is key that external justification, so a reason outside myself that I am doing said action, is subtle. A good example is doing a favor for something \u201cjust being nice\u201d\u009d versus being told or paid to do something. The person who is just being nice is going to like the receiver of the favor much more.\n\nSo in a successful relationship (of whatever type) it makes sense, then, that this give and take must be balanced. Person A might be constantly getting a high off of doing things for Person B (under the potentially false guise that doing these things is making Person B like person A more) but I would say that there is either minimal increases in how person B feels for A, or person B might not be doing favors for A, and either will feel insufficient or guilty about receiving from A, and the relationship goes off balance. Person B might learn to expect these favors from A, and take things for granted.\n\nSo what does this mean for good relationships? It means that one sided relationships only feed one person, and might even have negative consequences for the other. Both parties, to make themselves feel good, should do things for the other. The hard part is finding relationships in life, whether they be friendships, coworkers, or lovers, for which it is contextually appropriate to do favors for the other person that actually are things that you enjoy.\n\nI can try to think of examples. This first one is overly simple. Think of two friends that meet up to play tennis together. Each gets a lot of joy out of playing tennis, and in context of doing it for one another, both might like each other more than before, and rate each other as being closer friends.\n\nIn high school I used to bake cakes for all my friends on their birthdays. It was a \u201cfavor\u201d\u009d in the definition of the word, had little external motivation, but I loved baking by itself, and giving my beautiful creations to others made me feel good. The fact that I had these friends for which to do this baking, something that I love, made me like them more.\n\nSo maybe it isn\u2019t such a bad idea to ask people for favors to strengthen a relationship, or find out if it can be strengthened in that regard. From an opposite standpoint, if I ask someone for a favor and they turn me down, the exact opposite occurs. I guess it\u2019s all about balance, again, and this second idea is probably why I don\u2019t like to ask people for favors, ever. But in not asking, I don\u2019t let people do nice things for me, and feel everything that comes with that.\n\nAnd a beautiful idea that was said by one of my professors is the statement that \u201clove is not always a feeling, it\u2019s an action verb.\u201d\u009d If you do acts of love, give affection, even when you don\u2019t feel it, it will get you over those humps in a relationship when the feeling isn\u2019t there. I would say that friendship is an action verb as well, and this is exactly the reason that having deep, true friendships is a rarity \u2013 it takes a lot of energy, and it\u2019s a lot easier to expend less energy and remain on a superficial level.\n\nPersonally, I know that I put a lot of energy into friendships from high school after I went to college, and I\u2019m very lucky to still have my best friend. However, for the so many that I lost, I learned that my expenditure was largely a waste. As a result, I don\u2019t spend very much energy on other people anymore, unless I get some indication that the interaction might become balanced and two way. From my life experience I have learned to be weary of others as possibly a defense mechanism to avoid ultimately being forgotten. It\u2019s a selfish strategy and sometimes leaves me lonely, but it\u2019s a choice. And I can admit to starting on paths of friendship here, and either feeling overwhelmed by being the sole provider of energy, or just not enjoying the favors that I do enough for the other person to keep it going. I might start on a track of doing favors for the other person until it feels like some sort of expectation, and then I don\u2019t enjoy the friendship like I used to. So I\u2019ll just stop, and keep waiting for people to enter the picture that show an interest in knowing and understanding me, and also that I find fulfillment in doing things for. And it isn\u2019t that I cycle through people like index cards, I find that it is very hard to find people that:\n\n1) I can relate to  \n 2) open up to me, show honesty, humility, a sense of realness and ultimately  \n 3) I can trust\n\nSo welcome to my perception of my social scene at Duke University. It\u2019s a game of continually waiting for hints of interest in friendships, leaving your room and putting up a shell with the hopes of drawing people to you and also aiming to protect yourself. And although everyone arguably desires almost the same thing, we wind up with a bunch of young people walking around in social armor. Instead of being like fingers in a mitten, we all have our own enclosure as in a glove, and in those private spaces breed insecurities, some loneliness, unanswered questions, and eventually self-justification to reduce the dissonance and make the reality OK. What we can\u2019t see from our private spaces is that we are actually right next to each other, and going through the same thing.\n\nI also imagine all of us standing in individual boats on a great sea. There are many of us, we float on the same water, but no one dares risk climbing aboard someone else\u2019s boat for fear of being thrown overboard. Some speed around the sea, their boat driven by sexuality or task oriented business, and others are content to remain in one spot. And some boats are heavy, beautiful, and made of glass, some are grand and impressive to look at, but you know nothing about the person inside, others have a lot more holes, some patched and some left to slowly fill the boat with water, and some are even overturned with their inhabitant floating in the air pocket underneath. The boat with holes might not be as impressive as the majestic wooden one, but I would bet that the person inside has a lot better stories ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png) We want our boats to reflect who we are, but we also want them to look like what we think they should look like, and those two things aren\u2019t always the same thing. What does your boat look like?\n\nSo when two people do find each other, I think that it is largely situational, or accidental, but the result is always something to the effect of a huge appreciation for the other person, for the things you can do for that person, and wondering how life might have been had X not happened, had your friend not crashed his boat into yours, and forced an interaction.\n\nSo maybe the people that you like the most give you incentive to do things that you love, and a beautiful feeling of fulfillment and appreciation grows in a circular manner to build the foundation for a long lasting, successful relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s time to start crashing some boats, and taking some risks and jumping into other boats to see who is inside. This might be a lot easier for guys than girls, but that goes with the social expectation anyway. The worst thing that can happen is you get a little wet, and have to swim back to your boat.\n\n\n","html":"<p>but if off balance, it might push you away.<\/p>\n<p>The Ben Franklin Effect says that we come to like more those people for whom we do a favor.

Person B might learn to expect these favors from A, and take things for granted.<\/p>\n<p>So what does this mean for good relationships? It means that one sided relationships only feed one person, and might even have negative consequences for the other. Both parties, to make themselves feel good, should do things for the other. The hard part is finding relationships in life, whether they be friendships, coworkers, or lovers, for which it is contextually appropriate to do favors for the other person that actually are things that you enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>I can try to think of examples. This first one is overly simple. Think of two friends that meet up to play tennis together. Each gets a lot of joy out of playing tennis, and in context of doing it for one another, both might like each other more than before, and rate each other as being closer friends.<\/p>\n<p>In high school I used to bake cakes for all my friends on their birthdays. It was a &#8220;favor&#8221;\u009d in the definition of the word, had little external motivation, but I loved baking by itself, and giving my beautiful creations to others made me feel good. The fact that I had these friends for which to do this baking, something that I love, made me like them more.<\/p>\n<p>So maybe it isn&#8217;t such a bad idea to ask people for favors to strengthen a relationship, or find out if it can be strengthened in that regard. From an opposite standpoint, if I ask someone for a favor and they turn me down, the exact opposite occurs. I guess it&#8217;s all about balance, again, and this second idea is probably why I don&#8217;t like to ask people for favors, ever. But in not asking, I don&#8217;t let people do nice things for me, and feel everything that comes with that.<\/p>\n<p>And a beautiful idea that was said by one of my professors is the statement that &#8220;love is not always a feeling, it&#8217;s an action verb.&#8221;\u009d If you do acts of love, give affection, even when you don&#8217;t feel it, it will get you over those humps in a relationship when the feeling isn&#8217;t there. I would say that friendship is an action verb as well, and this is exactly the reason that having deep, true friendships is a rarity &#8211; it takes a lot of energy, and it&#8217;s a lot easier to expend less energy and remain on a superficial level.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I know that I put a lot of energy into friendships from high school after I went to college, and I&#8217;m very lucky to still have my best friend. However, for the so many that I lost, I learned that my expenditure was largely a waste. As a result, I don&#8217;t spend very much energy on other people anymore, unless I get some indication that the interaction might become balanced and two way. From my life experience I have learned to be weary of others as possibly a defense mechanism to avoid ultimately being forgotten. It&#8217;s a selfish strategy and sometimes leaves me lonely, but it&#8217;s a choice. And I can admit to starting on paths of friendship here, and either feeling overwhelmed by being the sole provider of energy, or just not enjoying the favors that I do enough for the other person to keep it going. I might start on a track of doing favors for the other person until it feels like some sort of expectation, and then I don&#8217;t enjoy the friendship like I used to. So I&#8217;ll just stop, and keep waiting for people to enter the picture that show an interest in knowing and understanding me, and also that I find fulfillment in doing things for. And it isn&#8217;t that I cycle through people like index cards, I find that it is very hard to find people that:<\/p>\n<p>1) I can relate to<br \/>\n2) open up to me, show honesty, humility, a sense of realness and ultimately<br \/>\n3) I can trust<\/p>\n<p>So welcome to my perception of my social scene at Duke University. It&#8217;s a game of continually waiting for hints of interest in friendships, leaving your room and putting up a shell with the hopes of drawing people to you and also aiming to protect yourself. And although everyone arguably desires almost the same thing, we wind up with a bunch of young people walking around in social armor. Instead of being like fingers in a mitten, we all have our own enclosure as in a glove, and in those private spaces breed insecurities, some loneliness, unanswered questions, and eventually self-justification to reduce the dissonance and make the reality OK. What we can&#8217;t see from our private spaces is that we are actually right next to each other, and going through the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>I also imagine all of us standing in individual boats on a great sea. There are many of us, we float on the same water, but no one dares risk climbing aboard someone else&#8217;s boat for fear of being thrown overboard. Some speed around the sea, their boat driven by sexuality or task oriented business, and others are content to remain in one spot. And some boats are heavy, beautiful, and made of glass, some are grand and impressive to look at, but you know nothing about the person inside, others have a lot more holes, some patched and some left to slowly fill the boat with water, and some are even overturned with their inhabitant floating in the air pocket underneath. The boat with holes might not be as impressive as the majestic wooden one, but I would bet that the person inside has a lot better stories <img src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" \/> We want our boats to reflect who we are, but we also want them to look like what we think they should look like, and those two things aren&#8217;t always the same thing. What does your boat look like?<\/p>\n<p>So when two people do find each other, I think that it is largely situational, or accidental, but the result is always something to the effect of a huge appreciation for the other person, for the things you can do for that person, and wondering how life might have been had X not happened, had your friend not crashed his boat into yours, and forced an interaction.<\/p>\n<p>So maybe the people that you like the most give you incentive to do things that you love, and a beautiful feeling of fulfillment and appreciation grows in a circular manner to build the foundation for a long lasting, successful relationship.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to start crashing some boats, and taking some risks and jumping into other boats to see who is inside. This might be a lot easier for guys than girls, but that goes with the social expectation anyway. The worst thing that can happen is you get a little wet, and have to swim back to your boat.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Mon, 24 Mar 2008 23:08:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 04 Jan 2014 23:55:33 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 24 Mar 2008 23:08:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":107,"title":"Ghost Ride it!","slug":"ghost-ride-it","markdown":"\n[The Ghost Rider](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fhf1TMOp7Rk) is pretty spectacular, if not embarrassing :O)\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Fhf1TMOp7Rk\">The Ghost Rider<\/a> is pretty spectacular, if not embarrassing :O)<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Tue, 08 Apr 2008 22:37:45 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 21:23:04 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 08 Apr 2008 22:37:45 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":105,"title":"What am I?","slug":"what-am-i","markdown":"\nIt shouldn\u2019t be such a hard question, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever put much thought into, or how it shapes my identity and sense of belonging.

Responsibilities, and obligations, and passions and social interactions, these things all require energy. There are people that I find drain this valuable resource, and people that fill me right back up. In some interactions, energy comes or goes like a trickle from a stream, and in others it might be taken or gifted in large, potentially overwhelming amounts. Which way is to better to give, and to receive? Which way is more apparent from one person to another? The nerd in me will talk about these two doses of energy in computer game terms, two types of healing spells from Wow, or World of Warcraft. You don\u2019t need to know anything about this game other than the metaphor: healers cast spells with mana to restore other players life, and keep them from crumping. A \u201cFlash of Light\u201d is a quick, tiny heal, and a \u201cHoly Light\u201d is a slower, but more powerful heal. The first is more of an economy heal, it uses a lot less mana, and delivers in much smaller doses. Both are important in the game, and for an interesting metaphor about energy expenditure in life.\n\n**Holy Light** I can look back on my life experience, and see times when I have been given energy in large amounts, and I think that this drastic a change can produce a dangerous high, that as soon as the source is removed, leads to a greater fall. So in the examples I am thinking of, it seems that blasting someone with Holy Light for an extended period of time would be exhausting to the giver and the receiver. I think that people have a threshold for receiving energy, just like many things, and the benefits of breaking the threshold are huge, but once you break it, the affects of additional energy are marginal. And the threshold holds for giving as well. So possibly the most fulfilling life experience comes from bouncing back and forth across this threshold, as opposed to remaining constant above and below it. it isn\u2019t the level that is very important, but rather the change in these levels.\n\nWhen these gifts come as a rare surprise, it can extremely energize and impress the receiver to make the giver feel even better than had he\/she tried to maintain in long term. In terms of relationships, if you think about the balance between giving and taking, this is why the tactic of being an endless well of giving isn\u2019t very good for either side. It will ultimately drain you, and potentially push the other person away, either due to being overwhelmed by the giving and feeling guilty about not reciprocating in an equal manner, or adapting to the unmaintainably high level and being disappointed when it drops.\n\nLike a Holy Light healing spell in WoW, the person receiving gets a lot more in that moment, but it takes a lot more mana, or energy, for the person giving it. In the long run, it hypothetically is a lot harder to maintain this level of giving\u20ac\u00a6 it drains the giver of energy. And this is why we have a tiny, efficient way of giving as well.\n\n**Flash of Light:** Giving marginally over time, to bounce into positive from negative territory, seems to be an efficient strategy for giver and receiver. The giver isn\u2019t drained of energy, and the receiver is maintained without being overstimulated or overly energized. When I give and receive little amounts of energy from other people during the day, largely without being aware of it, i find these days very positive and fulfilling. Combine a balance of this life energy interaction with the right perspective, and the concept that good and bad days just \u201chappen\u201d and are out of our control is completely eliminated.\n\nIt is also important to think about how people might react differently to similar amounts of energy. Someone that is used to receiving in large quantities might not get as much out of your act of kindness than someone who is not. People might grow up with different dynamics to expect receiving a certain amount of energy and time from other people, or not expect it. Either extreme seems dangerous\u20ac\u00a6 the people that expect it might be constantly disappointed in others, leading to a dynamic of one person exhausting him or herself trying to please the other, or the expectee being given up on by other people because he\/she is impossible to please. People that expect not receiving a lot of energy might learn to exist in a hyper-self-sufficient or solitary state, and learn that needing other people could be dangerous, and be overwhelmed when another person invests in them. We like to receive something called self-verification, or feedback that the way we look at ourselves is also the way that other people see us. So one person sending the message to another that \u201cyes, I value you, you are important,\u201d when the second person doesn\u2019t see him or herself as a person that is worthy of or needing value and attention, is going to lead to a turbulent relationship. On the other side of the pancake, a person whose identity is built up around greatness and being constantly pat on the back is going to feel cognitive dissonance when this constant reassurance does not come from another person, is stopped, questioned, or challenged. The bottom line is that if you don\u2019t interact and treat me in the way that supports how I think about myself, that\u2019s really scary.\n\nSo relationships of all types are intricate, and complicated, and too often opaque. Sharing what and more importantly HOW you think, I strongly believe, is the cement that holds us together. If I can try to understand how you look at the world, I might be able to place myself in your shoes, understand your thoughts and behavior more readily, and treat you in the best way I know how, given this insight.\n\nWhat happens is a lot less important than how I choose to perceive what happens. Understanding myself to know how I might perceive certain interactions and events can let me set up my life in a way that leads me to have interactions, and a schedule doing things for myself and others that has a lot higher probability of turning into a \u201cgood\u201d day. Other people rock my world, and I see myself as going from extremes of giving, possibly looking to receive, and then withdrawing when I feel disappointed. So here I am, briefly writing, but mostly thinking about the best ways to connect and relate to others while maintaining my own energy.\n\nThe answer then, as with many things, isn\u2019t one or the other, black and white. We give huge spurts of energy to people that we care about when levels might be dangerously low, and then more of a trickle over time to maintain our own reserves and continue telling the other person that we care about his or her wellbeing. This post is largely about quantity and quality. An interesting question comes up about distribution \u2013 how many people we choose to invest in, and whether that number has an affect on our ability to give trickles or spurts, or potentially spread ourselves too thin, like peanut butter ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png) But I guess that depends on your preferred ratio of PB to jelly!!!\n\nand these are hard questions, and in a discussion of energy I find my mind turning into a nice blue goo. And saying that I have an exam in 20 minutes, I better preserve whatever non-goo is left, and then go for a nice, long run and blast my brain with music, because not thinking is just as important.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Life seems to be a lot less about managing time, and resources, and a lot more about managing energy.

The bottom line is that if you don&#8217;t interact and treat me in the way that supports how I think about myself, that&#8217;s really scary.<\/p>\n<p>So relationships of all types are intricate, and complicated, and too often opaque. Sharing what and more importantly HOW you think, I strongly believe, is the cement that holds us together. If I can try to understand how you look at the world, I might be able to place myself in your shoes, understand your thoughts and behavior more readily, and treat you in the best way I know how, given this insight.<\/p>\n<p>What happens is a lot less important than how I choose to perceive what happens. Understanding myself to know how I might perceive certain interactions and events can let me set up my life in a way that leads me to have interactions, and a schedule doing things for myself and others that has a lot higher probability of turning into a &#8220;good&#8221; day. Other people rock my world, and I see myself as going from extremes of giving, possibly looking to receive, and then withdrawing when I feel disappointed. So here I am, briefly writing, but mostly thinking about the best ways to connect and relate to others while maintaining my own energy.<\/p>\n<p>The answer then, as with many things, isn&#8217;t one or the other, black and white. We give huge spurts of energy to people that we care about when levels might be dangerously low, and then more of a trickle over time to maintain our own reserves and continue telling the other person that we care about his or her wellbeing. This post is largely about quantity and quality. An interesting question comes up about distribution &#8211; how many people we choose to invest in, and whether that number has an affect on our ability to give trickles or spurts, or potentially spread ourselves too thin, like peanut butter <img src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" \/> But I guess that depends on your preferred ratio of PB to jelly!!!<\/p>\n<p>and these are hard questions, and in a discussion of energy I find my mind turning into a nice blue goo. And saying that I have an exam in 20 minutes, I better preserve whatever non-goo is left, and then go for a nice, long run and blast my brain with music, because not thinking is just as important.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Wed, 28 May 2008 05:17:17 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 04 Jan 2014 23:51:57 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 28 May 2008 05:17:17 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":99,"title":"My use, or overuse, of energy","slug":"my-use-or-overuse-of-energy","markdown":"\nI\u2019ve been continuing to think about energy as a currency of life, and how it pertains to my own life.

I think that it is more appropriate for romantic and friendship type relationships and less so family, but here is my idea.\n\nA lot of college kids are frustrated by the absence of a deep relationships, whether that be friendship or romance, I\u2019m sure it could be one or the other, both, or even vary by the day. In this frustration they (we) ask questions like \u201cwhat is wrong with me, what is wrong with this environment so i don\u2019t have what I think it is that I want, or deserve, and what do I have to do to get it?\u201d\u009d Then we stumble back and forth between vows of pro-active behavior, bouts of self pity, and blaming. In the best times, I realize, I\u2019m just distracted from thinking about it at all. Wait, in the best times I\u2019m not thinking about it at all? So in whatever I am doing, I see a pattern of being most content when I\u2019m not aware of my social-ness or lack of i it?? Rewind!\n\nSo how do we evaluate our relationships, how do we know where to put energy, where to hold back, and how do we evaluate ourselves as members of a social network? The answer is so much simpler than I thought possible \u2013 just relax and stop thinking about it. I know, it\u2019s not the most satisfactory answer, but hear me out.\n\nThere are many ways you might be attracted to a person, and when I say attraction I am referring to those things that make someone else interesting, and ultimately compel us to engage them. When I think of an ideal friend, partner, running buddy, I\u2019m pretty sure that my ideals aren\u2019t founded on anything deeper than \u201cwell we share these interests, he\u2019s a nice looking guy, he is similar to me,\u201d\u009d etc. Those are really products of the retrospectoscope \u2013 us attempting to put a label on something after the fact that we probably don\u2019t understand at all. I\u2019m not even sure that I am capable of telling you what lets conversation flow comfortably and naturally between me and another person, or makes me want to spend time with them, and seek them out. What it comes down to is the idea that \u201cgood\u201d\u009d relationships cannot be looked for, grown, forced, or predicted. We are going to put energy and time into people that we like to be around, that make us feel good, that we have a good dynamic with, really without thinking much about it. And if you stumble upon a two way street, you\u2019ve probably hit gold. But in the most enduring (best?) relationships, no matter what the type, we get something out of interacting with the other person, and that positive something that we get lasts over time. And given that dynamics and people change, this something can also be lost, and that can lead to distress or despair, and confusion. But there isn\u2019t much benefit of analyzing the black box that is this dynamic, trying to label incentives, track them, and do what I do way too much, over-think many of my relationships that aren\u2019t the way I want them to be, and ask why.\n\nBecause you largely can\u2019t answer that question, and more importantly, you don\u2019t need to. The beautiful thing about this idea is the realization that it\u2019s OK to not have yet found the other person, or other people, either friend or lover or confidant or running buddy, that might complement, complete, or fulfill you. Don\u2019t jump to concussions, it doesn\u2019t mean anything about you. But complete is a dangerous word, because with people, two incomplete people do not constitute a whole person. And this is exactly why it is best to focus on seeking personal fulfillment, whatever that means for you. And in pursuing what makes you happy, you will most certainly experience many types of relationships, learn from them, and hopefully find some rare sapphires.\n\nSo I started this thought by saying \u201cjust stop thinking,\u201d\u009d but I think it\u2019s important to still be aware- be aware of yourself, be aware of people that are directing energy toward you that you don\u2019t know much about at all, aware of keeping in checks with dynamics that you do value, and be aware of the bases that found your relationships. This is another beautiful metaphor \u2013 the idea that friendships can be looked at like structures. Built on the wrong base, perhaps just for social purposes and lacking compassion and a connection with one another, is like trying to build a tower in a sand pit. Adding floors to that tower will be very challenging, as well as finding structural stability. This is an interesting conversation I had with another friend, actually about the dynamics of conversation. Look at trends in conversation over time, and ask if one person is simply filling in gaps with an occasional \u201ccool, yeah, lol\u201d\u009d when it is appropriate, and essentially adding nothing to the other person\u2019s monologue, or does that person feel fed by what the other person has to say, and want to add something, respond, or challenge? It\u2019s easier to evaluate yourself as a responder, listener, and contributer, than the other person, I think. So it\u2019s interesting to think about what differentiates a rich conversation from one person telling things to another, and thinking that person is paying attention because he\/she is responding at the appropriate time.\n\nSo it seems like there is a huge component of personal awareness, learning to abolish expectations, and as a result, find patience through your passions.\n\nTime to listen to my own advice, mostly because it\u2019s been a long week, and I haven\u2019t done any work that I\u2019m \u201csupposed\u201d\u009d to do\n\n\u201cV, stop thinking about it\u201d\u009d\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d\u009d ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>I have a good friend that I often share the finest details of my analysis of people, behavior, and the social world.

It means exactly what you think it does!\u201d Examples, Vanessa examples!!\n\nExperience 1: I was finishing a run at East Campus one morning, and the bus was waiting at the stop. I was sprinting in, right towards in, in plain sight of a about half filled bus. About 20 feet from the door, it starts to pull away. That\u2019s OK, maybe the driver doesn\u2019t see me. It\u2019s quite a possibility, even though as a bus driver I would be very aware of people approaching my bus upon my decision to move. So I speed up, and make myself very visual. I\u2019m sprinting. I\u2019m next to the bus, I\u2019m next to the door, it\u2019s still not going very fast, I\u2019m waving, I see the driver, now it starts to pick up speed, and I find myself sprinting. What is going through my mind? Perhaps the driver has a strategy, or a rule, to make a decision about going and not stopping, and if that\u2019s the case, she is allowed to stop at the next stop, which is actually very close. I start to lose distance, but I\u2019m still next to the bus. She speeds right by the next bus stop. Finally I\u2019m in an all out sprint and the bus pulls ahead, I\u2019m killing myself running behind the bus, probably a quarter mile total, all around the bus loop down the road and under the bridge from East campus. She\u2019s not stopping. The likelihood that she DIDN\u2019T see me and NO one else on the bus did and alert her, is pretty small, and she didn\u2019t bother to stop for me at the next stop, where she is allowed to stop. She\u2019s obviously having a bad day, or taking something out on me, and there is no way she is going to stop. So I give up.\n\nThe entire experience really made me feel badly. it really hurt my feelings. I know she saw me, and my effort. So I start walking, for maybe 5 seconds, catch my breath, and then I feel something grow inside me. Despite my exhaustion from my already hard effort, I feel a second wind. And then I take off, at about a race pace, and I almost kill myself to make it to the bus stop on Anderson, where I would have gotten off. And since the bus loop is about half a mile longer than the straight shot, and the bus has to stop to pick up people, I beat the bus. And I stopped, and stood there to wait. Saw the bus approaching, and thought about what I might do. I could just stand there and stare, maybe put my hands on my hips, flash a quick middle finger? Did I want this to happen again, or confuse people on the bus that hadn\u2019t seen our interaction? Did I care?\n\nI started a big early wave, a big smile, and just held it. Looked the driver directly in the face when she passed, kept smiling and waving until the pass was complete. Oh damn, did it feel good. And I\u2019m sure that some of the passengers on the bus going from East to West were aware of her leaving me behind, it might have caused them some discomfort, and then maybe fulfilled or inspired by my small, but impressive and inspiring motion of peaceful retalliation. I\u2019m not really sure, but in the long run, it was a better release of my frustration then anything involving anger or even verbalization, or just keeping the feeling inside and not expressing it, because I see that driver quite frequently. And I \u20ac\u02dcve actually earned her respect. I wave at all the drivers while I\u2019m running, but now she waves at me too, and I choose to interpret that wave as \u201cdamn girl you sure showed me, and you\u2019re not so bad\u201d ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)\n\nExperience 2: An individual was staring at me in the gym, in an uncomfortable way. I don\u2019t mind harmless looking, or even a little staring, but when it gets so prolonged to the point that I am feeling violated by someone else\u2019s eyes, that it really isn\u2019t acceptable to me, the situation changes. It was an older individual and I might have been more flattered or at least subconsciously extended my time before feeling initial discomfort had that not been the case, but I had to let him know that I was aware of his staring, and maybe he needed to either stop, or do something more socially appropriate like converse with me. But the peeping around poles and staring thing was too creepy. So I just smiled and waved, and he went away. it was perfect, haha.

Today I realized that I prefer a partially filled water bottle. I am usually inclined to fill it up to the top, or at least let the water run until it is moderately above the label. But then adding flavor to it, it becomes more diluted, and it\u2019s has less room to mix. Personally, I enjoy the stronger flavor better, and don\u2019t need the entire volume of the bottle to quench my thirst. And if I am just carrying around water? A half filled bottle is a lot lighter, and I can always add more. Enough with the rationalization \u2013 the main point is that many little things that we do in life have become so habitual that we pass over examination that trying something differently may be very rewarding.\n\nSo I\u2019m not hammering down the overused phrase \u201cvariety is the spice of life!\u201d\u009d and encouraging you to examine and tweak absolutely everything you do because it\u2019s not OK to have ritual and habit. Those are good things, actually\u201d\u00a6 when you\u2019ve identified that you love something, and that it makes you happy, stick with it.

Today I realized that I prefer a partially filled water bottle. I am usually inclined to fill it up to the top, or at least let the water run until it is moderately above the label. But then adding flavor to it, it becomes more diluted, and it&#8217;s has less room to mix. Personally, I enjoy the stronger flavor better, and don&#8217;t need the entire volume of the bottle to quench my thirst. And if I am just carrying around water? A half filled bottle is a lot lighter, and I can always add more.

These forms of expression might be verifying of our identity, relieve stress, provide fulfillment, or a combination of those things. Whatever they do for us, I think that everyone might have a preferred way of expression that, when they do it, time slips through their fingers like noodles slip off a spoon in soup. When engaged in other things, the musician might move his fingers to the movement of music, or chords on his guitar, or the artist might see an interesting object and have an intense desire to paint it. You might call these passions, but I don\u2019t want to shift my discussion into motivation and goals, which we also like to build around our passions: they are another layer, another flavor on this Gobstopper of human fulfillment. Goals and motivations seem to be relevant to the construct of success\/failure and have a quality of expectation, while expression is not, and lacks that expectation.\n\nThe easiest way for me to talk about expression is to talk about my own experience. For me, my preferred form of expression is writing: obviously, right? ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png) And layered with that is movement and music. What is surprising to me is how much of my life I\u2019ve gone without this insight. So let\u2019 s start off with some questions.\n\n* Is it valuable to know or think about how you like to express yourself? and  \n * How do I go about figuring it out?\n\nAka, why should I care, and if I do care, what might I do if I\u2019m not sure?\n\n**Is it valuable to know or think about how you like to express yourself?**\n\nI would say yes. Feeling like you know yourself intimately, have an idea of what is going on in your head, why you might think certain things or act in a certain way, just feels good. This is all bundled into the rubber-band ball of seeking insight. It\u2019s also nice to know what sort of environments, people, and activities can both be a gas pump for our hearts and a recharger for our mental batteries. Maybe the danger of not knowing, and feeling disconnected and lacking fulfillment is reason enough to think about it. I also think that our preferred methods of expression are not static, and multifaceted, so when you think about it, you might go beyond the broad categories that I\u2019ve mentioned. For example, I enjoy writing while listening to music, always on the computer (because I can\u2019t physically write as fast as I think, and I find that frustrating), and I usually write when I am not with a group of people.) I also find myself speaking how I write sometimes, and one of the biggest reasons that I get lost in my runs is that I am writing in my head. But then you might ask, is it really the writing, or the thinking about certain ideas? Or is it the sharing of those ideas with other people? This is where the idea of expression expands. Possibly there is a core that I might label as \u20ac\u0153writing,\u20ac\u009d but all of those little appendages add additional value and make the entire experience more fulfilling for me. So expression isn\u2019t a solitary, definable activity, it is a collection of experiences, maybe even tied to ritual.\n\n**How do I go about figuring it out?**\n\nIt\u2019s easy: just have an epiphany, right? The gooey thing about finding insight into yourself is that I\u2019m not sure how to explain it, predict it, other than to encourage asking questions about yourself, both action and thought. I think that insight comes both with choice and chance. First, with adversity: so a tower crumbles before your eyes and you are forced to deal with the wreckage and then figure out how to build a new one. Why did the first one fall? Should you build the same one again, or do it differently?\n\nWe could also make the choice to ask questions about our tower, before it falls or draws anyone\u2019s attention (including our own) and this is a lot harder. On a daily basis this might be asking questions like \u20ac\u0153why do I enjoy this? Why did I do that?\u20ac\u009d \u20ac\u0153How do I feel about this situation, how did I express that feeling, and does the expression and true feeling coincide?\u20ac\u009d yeah, that\u2019s really hard, because if my tower is doing it\u2019s job of: being a good tower, why would I bother?\n\nTime to pull out my handy \u2013 retrospectoscope! I can describe the clues that have lead me to my own dynamic conclusions over many years, and maybe think about them in a broad sense to help you think about fulfilling expression.\n\n**Where did the time go? (Flow) Hours go by without you realizing it.**\n\nYou think about it when you aren\u2019t doing it. (Mental stimulation) I sometimes write in my head, either to myself or specific people. I have even had a few rare cases of mentally writing an email to someone, and then failing to realize that I never actually wrote or sent it, but somehow I solidified it in my mind so strongly to think that I did. I also might hear a song, and want to move like a wild thing, or get my creativity \u20ac\u0153flowing\u20ac\u009d by turning up the music.\n\nA sudden intense desire to do it. (Compulsion) Not in the sense of having obsessive compulsive disorder and needing to wash your hands and getting anxious about it, but just really looking forward to it, or maybe even using it as a reward. I know that I get ideas swarming in my head and have a profound desire to get them down. I have to write \u2013 and it\u2019s almost a tragedy if I have mentally written something and then misplace it in memory. No, not forgetting! I\u2019m a firm believer that people don\u2019t forget things:we just misplace in memory \u2013 because the tiniest stimulus or prime can make us say \u20ac\u0153oh yeah!\u20ac\u009d and remember.\n\nRocks do fall out of the sky and hit us in the head! (Unconscious processing) And in complete contradiction to most of what I said, I think it\u2019s safe to say that given time, there is a very high probability that you will become aware of how you like to express yourself. So another strategy is to just place thinking about it on the back burner. That\u2019s right, stop thinking about the layers of the gobstopper, and focus on enjoying the flavors. Mmmm.. delicious!\n\n\n","html":"<p>We all express ourselves in different ways: some through creating things that are beautiful, some through reading or writing, some through listening or playing music.

So let&#8217; s start off with some questions.<\/p>\n<p>* Is it valuable to know or think about how you like to express yourself? and<br \/>\n* How do I go about figuring it out?<\/p>\n<p>Aka, why should I care, and if I do care, what might I do if I&#8217;m not sure?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is it valuable to know or think about how you like to express yourself?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would say yes. Feeling like you know yourself intimately, have an idea of what is going on in your head, why you might think certain things or act in a certain way, just feels good. This is all bundled into the rubber-band ball of seeking insight. It&#8217;s also nice to know what sort of environments, people, and activities can both be a gas pump for our hearts and a recharger for our mental batteries. Maybe the danger of not knowing, and feeling disconnected and lacking fulfillment is reason enough to think about it. I also think that our preferred methods of expression are not static, and multifaceted, so when you think about it, you might go beyond the broad categories that I&#8217;ve mentioned. For example, I enjoy writing while listening to music, always on the computer (because I can&#8217;t physically write as fast as I think, and I find that frustrating), and I usually write when I am not with a group of people.) I also find myself speaking how I write sometimes, and one of the biggest reasons that I get lost in my runs is that I am writing in my head. But then you might ask, is it really the writing, or the thinking about certain ideas? Or is it the sharing of those ideas with other people? This is where the idea of expression expands. Possibly there is a core that I might label as \u20ac\u0153writing,\u20ac\u009d but all of those little appendages add additional value and make the entire experience more fulfilling for me. So expression isn&#8217;t a solitary, definable activity, it is a collection of experiences, maybe even tied to ritual.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do I go about figuring it out?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy: just have an epiphany, right? The gooey thing about finding insight into yourself is that I&#8217;m not sure how to explain it, predict it, other than to encourage asking questions about yourself, both action and thought. I think that insight comes both with choice and chance. First, with adversity: so a tower crumbles before your eyes and you are forced to deal with the wreckage and then figure out how to build a new one. Why did the first one fall? Should you build the same one again, or do it differently?<\/p>\n<p>We could also make the choice to ask questions about our tower, before it falls or draws anyone&#8217;s attention (including our own) and this is a lot harder. On a daily basis this might be asking questions like \u20ac\u0153why do I enjoy this? Why did I do that?\u20ac\u009d \u20ac\u0153How do I feel about this situation, how did I express that feeling, and does the expression and true feeling coincide?\u20ac\u009d yeah, that&#8217;s really hard, because if my tower is doing it&#8217;s job of: being a good tower, why would I bother?<\/p>\n<p>Time to pull out my handy &#8211; retrospectoscope! I can describe the clues that have lead me to my own dynamic conclusions over many years, and maybe think about them in a broad sense to help you think about fulfilling expression.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where did the time go? (Flow) Hours go by without you realizing it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You think about it when you aren&#8217;t doing it. (Mental stimulation) I sometimes write in my head, either to myself or specific people. I have even had a few rare cases of mentally writing an email to someone, and then failing to realize that I never actually wrote or sent it, but somehow I solidified it in my mind so strongly to think that I did. I also might hear a song, and want to move like a wild thing, or get my creativity \u20ac\u0153flowing\u20ac\u009d by turning up the music.<\/p>\n<p>A sudden intense desire to do it. (Compulsion) Not in the sense of having obsessive compulsive disorder and needing to wash your hands and getting anxious about it, but just really looking forward to it, or maybe even using it as a reward. I know that I get ideas swarming in my head and have a profound desire to get them down. I have to write &#8211; and it&#8217;s almost a tragedy if I have mentally written something and then misplace it in memory. No, not forgetting! I&#8217;m a firm believer that people don&#8217;t forget things:we just misplace in memory &#8211; because the tiniest stimulus or prime can make us say \u20ac\u0153oh yeah!\u20ac\u009d and remember.<\/p>\n<p>Rocks do fall out of the sky and hit us in the head! (Unconscious processing) And in complete contradiction to most of what I said, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that given time, there is a very high probability that you will become aware of how you like to express yourself. So another strategy is to just place thinking about it on the back burner. That&#8217;s right, stop thinking about the layers of the gobstopper, and focus on enjoying the flavors. Mmmm.. delicious!<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Tue, 01 Jul 2008 06:20:19 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 04 Jan 2014 23:40:58 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 01 Jul 2008 06:20:19 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":74,"title":"Contrast Gives Value to Experience","slug":"contrast-gives-value-to-experience","markdown":"\nWhen you are enjoying something, music, food, company, any experience, sometimes I think it\u2019s less about the quality or experience of the individual thing, and more about the differences and contrasts that give the individual things value relative to one another.

It\u2019s about learning from it and discovering ways to have a better future.\u201d\u009d* Laura King PhD University of Missouri\n\nI\u2019m engrossed in a magazine, right now actually, and I read that quote, and felt like writing. At the beginning of writing this I wasn\u2019t sure what I would be writing about, but after the fact I can tell you that this discussion is about relaxation, what it means, and different ways that we do, and don\u2019t, relax.\n\nThis weekend as I was headed down to a conference in Florida, another opportunity I stumbled upon, I couldn\u2019t help but realize that my incentive to go down and just have a fun weekend, see genetically-modified-orange-land and meet interesting people, didn\u2019t feel that way anymore. I was exhausted from a presentation on the Friday, probably a few two many miles, and woke up in the middle of the night with a stummyache, looked in the mirror at very tired eyes, and the question spreading through my thoughts was \u201cCan you sleep in? It sounds like such a beautiful idea\u201d\u00a6 gosh Vanessa, you just flew vertically across the country LAST weekend, and next week you have an exam and many plans made, and at the end of the summer you are travelling to California, New Hampshire, and Baltimore in under 72 hours\u201d\u00a6 and then the Fall semester starts on Monday. You look tired, yet you are thinking about this weekend trip, and your run in 5 hours. And you could, hypothetically, sleep in, but you won\u2019t. Why can\u2019t you just slow down?\u201d\u009d What the heck?\u201d\u009d\n\nAnd there was no point in rationalizing it, but I tried anyway, and it was pretty lame, I think I grinned at myself, and then got distracted by making faces in the mirror. It happens But not to get side-tracked\u201d\u00a6 I really don\u2019t know how to relax, at least in big ways. I would argue that I allow myself marginal relaxation over time\u201d\u00a6 closing my eyes on the bus, or lying in the sun, sitting on my bench enjoying my apple, walking through the gardens because I can\u201d\u00a6 but I would call this active relaxing, more mental relaxing as opposed to physical relaxing. I think these two things largely come together, in varying levels\u201d\u00a6 you could think of a Relaxation Gauge being composed of two parallel bars, one for physical relaxation and one for mental.\n\nComplete lack of physical and mental relaxation is probably a fight or flight response, and complete mental and physical relaxation is probably achieved through something like sleep or yoga (although I\u2019m not a huge yogee)\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about ways in which people relax. I think it\u2019s safe to categorize relaxation into two types: physical and mental, and within those two types we can talk about external motivation to relax (going to your YOGA class, out to dinner with friends) and internal motivation (collapsing from being tired, getting an injury or sickness). When I put it in those terms, it feels like my own bias is coming in: I largely relax when other people give me incentive to, or when my body and\/or mind just push the big red \u201cABORT\u201d\u009d button, something happens so I don\u2019t have a choice.\n\nIt\u2019s like I keep moving at the same pace regardless of my responsibility, and if I slow down, I\u2019m not sure what I would do with myself. I just don\u2019t know how to do it\u201d\u00a6 I\u2019d jump on some new idea or project or at a minimum, a new something to watch accompanied by doing something creative all the while maintaining my connection with Gmail\n\nBut there is a difference between internal and external responsibilities. Keeping myself occupied with, watching LOST for example, has a certain amount of mindless enjoyment and is probably the extent of my ability to relax, coming just before sleep, which is just being unconscious right? That probably doesn\u2019t count. Creating external business, like scheduling to leave for Florida 30 minutes after the end of a class presentation, arriving late at night, and then reporting to a University dressed in a black suit early the next morning for two days of scheduled meetings, then coming home at the last minute on Sunday to launch into another week of class and work, is different. It pretty much eliminates a lot of the potential for large scale physical and mental relaxation. Schedules do that, I think. I might still get my marginal relaxation in \u2013 like sitting on the floor at the airport and staring into nowhere, sleeping on the plane, and going to bed early, but are these tiny tastes enough to maintain a human being?\n\nAnd after recalling this weekends\u2019 plans, I want to distinguish this busy-ness from stress, because that entire thing sounds pretty stressful. I organize things in a way that, at least from my perception, don\u2019t feel stressful. Back to this weekend trip\u201d\u00a6 all I had to do was walk 100 meters, get on the bus back to my apartment, and wait for my cab to come and drive me to the airport. So no, not a stressful weekend, not to say that stress and busyness don\u2019t commonly go together, but less so for me.\n\nSo what does one do in the middle of the night with a delay in going back to sleep? I had a book on my bedside wire bookcase (Target special) under a bunch of inappropriately warm weathered New Hampshire hats, but books don\u2019t talk back, so I woke up my laptop, and went to see which of my college friend crazies were still awake at the wee hours of the morning. Quite a few, actually. You crazies, go to sleep\n\nAs one of my special crazies and I chat about people, me mostly telling stories about interactions that I have found fulfilling, I kept my pondering of why I was questioning my \u201cbeautifully\u201d\u009d planned out weekend on the back-burner. I know this weekend would have had many fulfilling and self-esteem\/efficacy boosting components, but my reaction was still \u201ceww.\u201d\u009d Why, and how might I act on this cognition? Should I act at all? So I decided that if the ewey-ness lasted into the morning when I woke up again, since it was so novel and demanding attention, I should give it. It might be a strong sign that even if I don\u2019t know how to do so, my body and mind want to slow down. That was pretty exciting to think, actually\u201d\u00a6 step 1 in slowing down\u201d\u00a6 unconscious desire brought into awareness to do it!\n\nSo I woke up, and it was still there, and almost as if forcing someone else\u2019s hand to do the dialing, I called the airline, my hotel, the taxi service, and left a message with the company that no, I wouldn\u2019t be there this weekend\u201d\u00a6 but have a good one, Saturday is supposed to be beautiful. And in forcing myself to put a halt on these things, the cognitive squirminess started to grow, and I let it flow in an effort to understand it, maybe ask a lot of wrong and one or two right questions, and hopefully get some insight into why it\u2019s so hard for me to slow down, to relax.\n\nAnd here we are. All that said, I\u2019m still keeping myself busy with those less external responsibilities, but it\u2019s definitely a step down from what I was originally scheduled to do. And I\u2019m quote excited about my decision, actually, because it has started this new thought process, and I had a few small but incredibly fulfilling interactions that just wouldn\u2019t have happened had I been on an airplane to Daytona Beach. And of course you could say the same about me being there are not here\u201d\u00a6 the butterfly effect right? But that doesn\u2019t matter, because I\u2019m here and not there, but I do understand that we are inclined to look positively on the decisions we made, and at least neutrally about things that we passed over.\n\nIt all goes back to that idea of keeping in check with yourself, and taking self compassion to another level of applicability. Not when things go wrong, but when they go right too, knowing when it\u2019s OK to say no to even something that might be really great because it throws you off balance. And speaking from this experience, I suspect that figuring out when you are going off balance is the hardest part.\n\nAnd here is where you might expect more conclusions, but I can\u2019t comply. I know that I want to have a larger element of slowing down in my life, eventually, and that I will probably benefit from it, but I don\u2019t know how to do it. I know that I\u2019d love to dance, to be able to lie down into beautiful sleep without my body forcing me into it, and to not feel the need to be moving at the same, pretty hectic pace. Uhl. Where to start thinking?\n\nScheduling physical and or mental relaxation might work to slow down, but my historical data tells me that I won\u2019t do that, at least just for myself.\n\nThe biggest force that has even given me any incentive to slow down has always been other people. Different levels of relationships slow me down to different degrees, for example friends provide relaxed dinners and going fun places and good conversation, I love my friends. But the frequency of this is pretty low, despite the high quality of the time. I might amass a gazillion little connections like these to slow me down, but I think that would be spreading one person too thin. I sort of enjoy the level that I have right now, it feels right.\n\nI\u2019ve also been forced to slow down by injury and medical adversity, and although I wouldn\u2019t omit those experiences from my life, they largely sucked, and I\u2019m not looking to have any part of me opened up again. And getting injured is the ultimate emotional poo-fest, because running and feeling strong adds so much positive to my life.\n\nI don\u2019t have any answers for myself, at the moment, beyond people. I\u2019d be interested to know how other people relax, so maybe I can gain insight into myself. The ironic part, the surprising part, is that I\u2019m quite happy being this way, I\u2019m loving life at the moment, despite those tired eyes that look back at me pretty frequently. I think that my future oriented self is sort of hoping that the me in 5 years will have learned and changed and possibly be more insightful than the me of today. The incentive is out there for my life outlook to change drastically in terms of the speed that I move, think, and live, but I just haven\u2019t found the catalyst yet. Perhaps I haven\u2019t asked the right questions, or I haven\u2019t figured out how to ask them, or found someone that influences me to do so. It\u2019s sort of ambiguous, but I am confident that these things come with time.\n\nUntil that time, I have to listen to my gut, and keep checks on staying balanced. So onward \u2013 give the oxen adequate rations, continue the grueling pace, and let\u2019s ford that approaching river and turn the ox cart into a boat.\n\n\n","html":"<p><em>&#8220;Being happy isn&#8217;t about forgetting the past. It&#8217;s about learning from it and discovering ways to have a better future.&#8221;\u009d<\/em> Laura King PhD University of Missouri<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m engrossed in a magazine, right now actually, and I read that quote, and felt like writing. At the beginning of writing this I wasn&#8217;t sure what I would be writing about, but after the fact I can tell you that this discussion is about relaxation, what it means, and different ways that we do, and don&#8217;t, relax.<\/p>\n<p>This weekend as I was headed down to a conference in Florida, another opportunity I stumbled upon, I couldn&#8217;t help but realize that my incentive to go down and just have a fun weekend, see genetically-modified-orange-land and meet interesting people, didn&#8217;t feel that way anymore. I was exhausted from a presentation on the Friday, probably a few two many miles, and woke up in the middle of the night with a stummyache, looked in the mirror at very tired eyes, and the question spreading through my thoughts was &#8220;Can you sleep in? It sounds like such a beautiful idea&#8221;\u00a6 gosh Vanessa, you just flew vertically across the country LAST weekend, and next week you have an exam and many plans made, and at the end of the summer you are travelling to California, New Hampshire, and Baltimore in under 72 hours&#8221;\u00a6 and then the Fall semester starts on Monday. You look tired, yet you are thinking about this weekend trip, and your run in 5 hours. And you could, hypothetically, sleep in, but you won&#8217;t. Why can&#8217;t you just slow down?&#8221;\u009d What the heck?&#8221;\u009d<\/p>\n<p>And there was no point in rationalizing it, but I tried anyway, and it was pretty lame, I think I grinned at myself, and then got distracted by making faces in the mirror. It happens But not to get side-tracked&#8221;\u00a6 I really don&#8217;t know how to relax, at least in big ways. I would argue that I allow myself marginal relaxation over time&#8221;\u00a6 closing my eyes on the bus, or lying in the sun, sitting on my bench enjoying my apple, walking through the gardens because I can&#8221;\u00a6 but I would call this active relaxing, more mental relaxing as opposed to physical relaxing. I think these two things largely come together, in varying levels&#8221;\u00a6 you could think of a Relaxation Gauge being composed of two parallel bars, one for physical relaxation and one for mental.<\/p>\n<p>Complete lack of physical and mental relaxation is probably a fight or flight response, and complete mental and physical relaxation is probably achieved through something like sleep or yoga (although I&#8217;m not a huge yogee)<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s talk about ways in which people relax. I think it&#8217;s safe to categorize relaxation into two types: physical and mental, and within those two types we can talk about external motivation to relax (going to your YOGA class, out to dinner with friends) and internal motivation (collapsing from being tired, getting an injury or sickness). When I put it in those terms, it feels like my own bias is coming in: I largely relax when other people give me incentive to, or when my body and\/or mind just push the big red &#8220;ABORT&#8221;\u009d button, something happens so I don&#8217;t have a choice.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like I keep moving at the same pace regardless of my responsibility, and if I slow down, I&#8217;m not sure what I would do with myself. I just don&#8217;t know how to do it&#8221;\u00a6 I&#8217;d jump on some new idea or project or at a minimum, a new something to watch accompanied by doing something creative all the while maintaining my connection with Gmail<\/p>\n<p>But there is a difference between internal and external responsibilities. Keeping myself occupied with, watching LOST for example, has a certain amount of mindless enjoyment and is probably the extent of my ability to relax, coming just before sleep, which is just being unconscious right? That probably doesn&#8217;t count. Creating external business, like scheduling to leave for Florida 30 minutes after the end of a class presentation, arriving late at night, and then reporting to a University dressed in a black suit early the next morning for two days of scheduled meetings, then coming home at the last minute on Sunday to launch into another week of class and work, is different. It pretty much eliminates a lot of the potential for large scale physical and mental relaxation. Schedules do that, I think. I might still get my marginal relaxation in &#8211; like sitting on the floor at the airport and staring into nowhere, sleeping on the plane, and going to bed early, but are these tiny tastes enough to maintain a human being?<\/p>\n<p>And after recalling this weekends&#8217; plans, I want to distinguish this busy-ness from stress, because that entire thing sounds pretty stressful.

Although everyone has a little bit of when, then, and now in them (just like how Mini Me suggested in Austin Powers that everyone should try having a little mini in them) I would speculate that specific individuals might err stronger in one type than another. For simplicity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s place each type into one body. Let\u2019s call our future oriented folk the \u201cwhens,\u201d our past-focused-people the \u201cthens\u201d and our presently living patriots the \u201cnows.\u201d\n\n****\n\nHow do we measure our characters? I am creating these hypothetical groups based on activity in the reward system (hypothalamus?). When I say present versus future versus past oriented, I am thinking about preferences, and measuring the activity in the reward system when either engaging in something in the present, thinking about engaging in it, or remembering engaging in it. I hypothesize that someone who would classify him or herself as more future\/goal oriented or a \u201cplanner\u201d might have the greatest activity in their reward center when thinking about something in the future as opposed to remembering doing it or actually doing it in the present.\n\nLet\u2019s call this measure of reward or happiness \u201cwoo\u201d points, which is currency I made up in a previous entry. Again, it\u2019s probably not about comparing and finding averages of woo points between individuals, but about looking at the difference between levels within the individual. Person A and Person B might be in completely different galaxies with regard to the scale of their woo points, but have comparable proportions and consequently have similar preferences.\n\nLet\u2019s use our characters to talk about time perception and valuation. How do we think about time? In different ways, I suspect, depending on your reward system and ability to make decisions. How much do we perceive to be in control of our time, and how valid is this belief? I think we all have different units in which we think about time. For me, life exists in daily cycles, and I must milk each day for all that it\u2019s worth. When I run today I have no care for how hard my running today will affect my tomorrow. Perhaps I can change that to 24 hour cycles, because when I goto sleep I do count 6 or 7 fingers to see when my body is going to open its eyes, and what time that is relative to the start of class, when something opens, or when the sun rises. When I have had a completely awful day or am overly hard on myself, I am comforted by the fact that life almost resets when I goto sleep and wake up the next morning. I get another chance when darkness fades, to feel better or do right what seemed so wrong, and its usually the case that I wake up and my big wrong of the previous day seems sort of silly, or that I gave it much more attention than it deserved. But at this point, the wrong is in the past, and I like to think about the future. Let\u2019s talk about our \u201cwhens.\u201d\n\n**The Whens**\n\nThe whens indulge in thinking about what might be, and create goals and plans to lead up to those moments. Whens use the past as an experience of lessons, and correlate actions with consequences in an effort to learn to prevent or exacerbate those outcomes. Action and dreaming are done, of course, in the ephemeral present, combined with distraction when a break is needed. How might we apply some scale to the future? There is the near future and the far future, and whens live in both. The present can be a double edged sword because a when might be doing something to increase or work towards far future options, but making choices on a daily basis prunes near future options.\n\nOur whens really like these options, and for things to be open and free. Possibly narrowing down options or taking out choices of things that \u201cmight be\u201d could be distressing, and lead to indecisiveness in the present. Deciding upon X or Y is really hard, because if we choose X then we can\u2019t indulge in thinking about the possibility of Y anymore. Matter of fact, in making decisions we decrease overall woo points, and are at a loss. Why? Because being able to dream about both X AND Y might have been more neurochemically rewarding than just X. But this isn\u2019t to say that whens don\u2019t know how to make choices about the future. When those choices are made, the focus simply zooms in, and becomes about the smaller pieces. If we are future oriented, narrowing down future choices might diminish present reward, and that is countered by breaking our decision into component or additional parts to think about. As long as some indulgence is there, the whens have their mental blankie, and it\u2019s all good. But sometimes the dreamed goal could be coming on too fast, and in this case, time becomes an enemy.\n\nTime could be a hard thing for our whens. If you live in a future dream and are convinced that you must be X,Y,and Z within this constrained time to get to the moment you glamorize, you will certainly stress and worry and feel out of control of your time. Whens might set rigid ways in using their time that they deem to best become what they dream to be, and sacrifice present happiness for that future time, justify present discomfort or unhappiness with that future moment. This is when maladaptive beliefs are formed, and maintained, and they are largely unconscious. I think that these beliefs can be applied to any domain, and largely, have the same structure. A when might think something like \u201cIn order to achieve (this future outcome) I must (do this and sacrifice this) in the present\u201d In strictly adhering to the \u201cdo this\u201d part, our whens never try anything differently, and never learn that they might be able to accomplish the same things without sacrificing as much present happiness. On a larger scale, our whens never think about the idea that the future moment of fulfillment may never be realized, because it will always be just that, in the future. Even broader, in getting so consumed with this goal, the whens never introspect and figure out what really fulfills them, makes them happy, as human beings.\n\nBut putting a fork in this steam powered cycle would require one of two things. Either making the choice to marginally ease up on the rigid beliefs and see that the craved future is still there, yet present life is remarkably improved, or having something big and obvious happen that is like a red flag for our whens to stop, and look up. Hopefully, our whens learn that most of life, and wellbeing, is a choice, and that it is possible to maintain a beautiful future moment without sacrificing the present.\n\nThe when as\u20ac\u00a6\n\n**CONSUMER** Let\u2019s think about buying something. Whens buying patterns might be based on a future outlook. Other than the obvious \u201cneed\u201d created by marketing\/advertising, I think that a lot of purchasing is done based on the unconscious mindset that something available to me right now may not be available at some future point, or not conveniently available. For example, running shorts disguised as skirts are gaining popularity right now, and I\u2019m a huge fan of feeling feminine while being able to escape at any moment. I was excited to think about buying a second black skort, because I reasoned that I wore it so frequently and loved it so much that having another one as backup, for security, made sense. However, before I made the purchase, the thought occurred to me that I didn\u2019t need to prepare for the destruction of my current skirt. It just hadn\u2019t occurred to me that when it happened, the likelihood of being able to get a very similar one, in that present moment, was very high, and that I didn\u2019t currently need the second one. I didn\u2019t buy the skirt. Interesting.\n\n**ROMANTIC **In terms of relationships, if you\u2019ve watched recent TED talks by Helen Fisher you might have noticed the relation to love as an addiction. For the whens, the addiction might be in thinking about the person, in thinking about a beautiful future with the face that we mentally crave. For these future oriented thinkers, when you remove the possibility in the present, that doesn\u2019t eliminate the craving and need for those future moments. This is what leads to one type of heartbreak. But it also leads to a solid base for a long term relationship if the love is mutual. Another double edged sword, or maybe a rose bush metaphor fits better here.\n\n**CHRISTMAS!!** With regards to any planned event, like a holiday, for example, I would say that the whens get a lot more reward about thinking about the experience of the event as opposed to actually experiencing it. At least that is pretty consistent for me, but this might just be a result of overly magnificent expectations as I indulge in this future moment, and then disappointment when it turns out, as it usually does. But it\u2019s hard to set expectations lower than what you\u2019ve already experienced, so even when you don\u2019t indulge in thinking about the future, it\u2019s a lot harder to be surprised as we adapt to life.\n\n**Overall: **So I didn\u2019t talk about our nows and thens, mostly because I find myself in an environment and culture of whens. I think that the structure of society serves to sort our \u201cwhens,\u201d \u201cthens,\u201d and \u201cnows.\u201d if you are a when, you are very good at planning and preparing and acting with regard to the future, so you might do better in school. Thus, is it possible that the top universities are biased towards people that, overall, get more reward in thinking about the future? Could we run a test to determine if \u201cquality\u201d of the school in terms of how hard it is to get in somehow correlates with being future oriented? Then we can take a look at, Duke\u2019s population for example, and break it down even further. Are the kids that enjoy partying, study and do work at the last minute, more present oriented? Are the kids that preoccupy themselves and even sacrifice present happiness for some future goal or moment more future oriented? Do we just throw everyone else that doesn\u2019t plan or party compulsively into the \u201cthen\u201d category?\n\nWhy did I ask this question? My thinking about time began with a bathroom stall in Sanford. Not in intending to use it, but in (questionably) accidentally finding it. I entered the building after a long run with an itch to re-explore its intricate and confusing architecture of stairs, people pockets, and inappropriately placed swiveling chairs. It seems that after all these years it hasn\u2019t been high on the priority list to replace the print-out bathroom door labels with anything other than an 8.5\u20ac\u00b3 X 11,\u201d (but at least they got an e-print!) so when I saw the one labeled \u201cWomen\u201d on the second floor I figured I might ward off future discomfort by going now, since it was convenient.\n\nClosure is an elusive concept, and it is found in unexpected moments and ways. There are people and events in my life from which I still consciously hunger for closure, and ones that I don\u2019t consciously think about, and then find it anyway. The second I stepped into this second floor bathroom the memory of a day in early February of 2007 flooded my memory. It was here that came after Pub Pol 55D with a pretty strange stomach ache that ultimately was catalyst for a surgery. This moment preceded huge physical and emotional pain, but I hadn\u2019t known that, in that particular section of time. And it was amazing how quickly my mind placed me in that moment of discomfort, confusion, and uncertainty, and how, knowing what I presently knew, it was almost tragic to see my ignorant self about to cross into challenging times. Yet there was no thinking, analysis, or introspection beyond the memory of that feeling. Like the flick of a switch I conquered that moment. And in conquering that moment, I had conquered the entire experience. i had found closure, a feeling of peace and forgiveness towards the experience, almost like I looked the hairy beast from my past in the eyes, and did not avert my gaze. The moment was both powerful and humbling, and now the experience is best represented by the scar that it left. I am forever, visibly marked, but no longer vulnerable to the pain of the experience.\n\nThe way in which my brain rewinded to that moment, started my thinking about time. I realized that my mind also has the ability to fast forward to a future moment that I predict will be wonderful, in comparison to what precedes it. Standing on the line at races, or right before an exam, I can mentally fast forward to the time after the race, after the exam, and before I know it, I am there. With regards to a long run, I don\u2019t think about the distance or \u201cwhat is left,\u201d but instead see myself at the next interesting marker along the way, and then I\u2019m there. But you have to be careful not to fast forward the entirety of life. It\u2019s like a story that I heard as a child of a boy that was given a magical string \u2013 tugging the string accelerated time\u20ac\u00a6 so when it was spring he wanted it to be fall, when it was fall he again wanted spring, so before long he pulled his entire life away.\n\nI am a \u201cwhen\u201d that struggles with the insight of a \u201cnow.\u201d I don\u2019t talk a lot about how I perceive life and death, and the uncertainty of it all, mostly because I don\u2019t think telling someone about experience is enough to change their life outlook beyond a knowledge perspective. I can tell you that it made me question and challenge my every behavior and thinking, and figure out how to deal with the grinding between my more neurologically wired \u201cwhen-ness\u201d and forced epiphany of \u201cnow-ness.\u201d\n\nIt seems to me that for everyone, everyday, regardless of what you believe or are told is the case, life is largely uncertain. Whether your life expectancy is eight or eighty years, both are on par, and you can\u2019t use that expectation to dictate the now. But I love to indulge in my planning, my goals, and making things happen. The best way I\u2019ve dealt with the conflict is to actively pursue balance. There is a certain tipping point when sacrificing present happiness for something in the future makes that future moment not worth it. (And no, I haven\u2019t read that book, and I\u2019m not sure how the author uses that phrase, although a friend is hopefully going to let me borrow it ) I\u2019ve adjusted that point away from this glamorized future moment, because what we do have, to find beauty and fulfillment in, is the present moment, and the larger insight is that for most people that live for the future, well, can you actually get there, and if you do, will you feel how you expected? What keeps me balanced is taking the specificity and expectation out of where \u201cI am going,\u201d and just trusting that it\u2019s going to be good. It allows for learning how to observe and be like those rare \u201cnowers\u201d, who do seem to know quite a lot.\n\n\n","html":"<p>This is a story about the whens, the thens, and the nows. Although everyone has a little bit of when, then, and now in them (just like how Mini Me suggested in Austin Powers that everyone should try having a little mini in them) I would speculate that specific individuals might err stronger in one type than another. For simplicity&#8217;s sake, let&#8217;s place each type into one body. Let&#8217;s call our future oriented folk the &#8220;whens,&#8221; our past-focused-people the &#8220;thens&#8221; and our presently living patriots the &#8220;nows.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong><\/p>\n<p>How do we measure our characters?<\/strong> I am creating these hypothetical groups based on activity in the reward system (hypothalamus?). When I say present versus future versus past oriented, I am thinking about preferences, and measuring the activity in the reward system when either engaging in something in the present, thinking about engaging in it, or remembering engaging in it. I hypothesize that someone who would classify him or herself as more future\/goal oriented or a &#8220;planner&#8221; might have the greatest activity in their reward center when thinking about something in the future as opposed to remembering doing it or actually doing it in the present.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s call this measure of reward or happiness &#8220;woo&#8221; points, which is currency I made up in a previous entry. Again, it&#8217;s probably not about comparing and finding averages of woo points between individuals, but about looking at the difference between levels within the individual. Person A and Person B might be in completely different galaxies with regard to the scale of their woo points, but have comparable proportions and consequently have similar preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use our characters to talk about time perception and valuation. How do we think about time? In different ways, I suspect, depending on your reward system and ability to make decisions. How much do we perceive to be in control of our time, and how valid is this belief? I think we all have different units in which we think about time. For me, life exists in daily cycles, and I must milk each day for all that it&#8217;s worth. When I run today I have no care for how hard my running today will affect my tomorrow. Perhaps I can change that to 24 hour cycles, because when I goto sleep I do count 6 or 7 fingers to see when my body is going to open its eyes, and what time that is relative to the start of class, when something opens, or when the sun rises. When I have had a completely awful day or am overly hard on myself, I am comforted by the fact that life almost resets when I goto sleep and wake up the next morning. I get another chance when darkness fades, to feel better or do right what seemed so wrong, and its usually the case that I wake up and my big wrong of the previous day seems sort of silly, or that I gave it much more attention than it deserved. But at this point, the wrong is in the past, and I like to think about the future. Let&#8217;s talk about our &#8220;whens.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Whens<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The whens indulge in thinking about what might be, and create goals and plans to lead up to those moments. Whens use the past as an experience of lessons, and correlate actions with consequences in an effort to learn to prevent or exacerbate those outcomes. Action and dreaming are done, of course, in the ephemeral present, combined with distraction when a break is needed. How might we apply some scale to the future? There is the near future and the far future, and whens live in both. The present can be a double edged sword because a when might be doing something to increase or work towards far future options, but making choices on a daily basis prunes near future options.<\/p>\n<p>Our whens really like these options, and for things to be open and free. Possibly narrowing down options or taking out choices of things that &#8220;might be&#8221; could be distressing, and lead to indecisiveness in the present. Deciding upon X or Y is really hard, because if we choose X then we can&#8217;t indulge in thinking about the possibility of Y anymore. Matter of fact, in making decisions we decrease overall woo points, and are at a loss. Why? Because being able to dream about both X AND Y might have been more neurochemically rewarding than just X. But this isn&#8217;t to say that whens don&#8217;t know how to make choices about the future. When those choices are made, the focus simply zooms in, and becomes about the smaller pieces. If we are future oriented, narrowing down future choices might diminish present reward, and that is countered by breaking our decision into component or additional parts to think about. As long as some indulgence is there, the whens have their mental blankie, and it&#8217;s all good. But sometimes the dreamed goal could be coming on too fast, and in this case, time becomes an enemy.<\/p>\n<p>Time could be a hard thing for our whens. If you live in a future dream and are convinced that you must be X,Y,and Z within this constrained time to get to the moment you glamorize, you will certainly stress and worry and feel out of control of your time. Whens might set rigid ways in using their time that they deem to best become what they dream to be, and sacrifice present happiness for that future time, justify present discomfort or unhappiness with that future moment. This is when maladaptive beliefs are formed, and maintained, and they are largely unconscious. I think that these beliefs can be applied to any domain, and largely, have the same structure. A when might think something like &#8220;In order to achieve (this future outcome) I must (do this and sacrifice this) in the present&#8221; In strictly adhering to the &#8220;do this&#8221; part, our whens never try anything differently, and never learn that they might be able to accomplish the same things without sacrificing as much present happiness. On a larger scale, our whens never think about the idea that the future moment of fulfillment may never be realized, because it will always be just that, in the future. Even broader, in getting so consumed with this goal, the whens never introspect and figure out what really fulfills them, makes them happy, as human beings.<\/p>\n<p>But putting a fork in this steam powered cycle would require one of two things. Either making the choice to marginally ease up on the rigid beliefs and see that the craved future is still there, yet present life is remarkably improved, or having something big and obvious happen that is like a red flag for our whens to stop, and look up. Hopefully, our whens learn that most of life, and wellbeing, is a choice, and that it is possible to maintain a beautiful future moment without sacrificing the present.<\/p>\n<p>The when as\u20ac\u00a6<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONSUMER<\/strong> Let&#8217;s think about buying something. Whens buying patterns might be based on a future outlook. Other than the obvious &#8220;need&#8221; created by marketing\/advertising, I think that a lot of purchasing is done based on the unconscious mindset that something available to me right now may not be available at some future point, or not conveniently available. For example, running shorts disguised as skirts are gaining popularity right now, and I&#8217;m a huge fan of feeling feminine while being able to escape at any moment. I was excited to think about buying a second black skort, because I reasoned that I wore it so frequently and loved it so much that having another one as backup, for security, made sense. However, before I made the purchase, the thought occurred to me that I didn&#8217;t need to prepare for the destruction of my current skirt. It just hadn&#8217;t occurred to me that when it happened, the likelihood of being able to get a very similar one, in that present moment, was very high, and that I didn&#8217;t currently need the second one. I didn&#8217;t buy the skirt. Interesting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ROMANTIC <\/strong>In terms of relationships, if you&#8217;ve watched recent TED talks by Helen Fisher you might have noticed the relation to love as an addiction. For the whens, the addiction might be in thinking about the person, in thinking about a beautiful future with the face that we mentally crave. For these future oriented thinkers, when you remove the possibility in the present, that doesn&#8217;t eliminate the craving and need for those future moments. This is what leads to one type of heartbreak. But it also leads to a solid base for a long term relationship if the love is mutual. Another double edged sword, or maybe a rose bush metaphor fits better here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CHRISTMAS!!<\/strong> With regards to any planned event, like a holiday, for example, I would say that the whens get a lot more reward about thinking about the experience of the event as opposed to actually experiencing it. At least that is pretty consistent for me, but this might just be a result of overly magnificent expectations as I indulge in this future moment, and then disappointment when it turns out, as it usually does. But it&#8217;s hard to set expectations lower than what you&#8217;ve already experienced, so even when you don&#8217;t indulge in thinking about the future, it&#8217;s a lot harder to be surprised as we adapt to life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Overall: <\/strong>So I didn&#8217;t talk about our nows and thens, mostly because I find myself in an environment and culture of whens. I think that the structure of society serves to sort our &#8220;whens,&#8221; &#8220;thens,&#8221; and &#8220;nows.&#8221; if you are a when, you are very good at planning and preparing and acting with regard to the future, so you might do better in school. Thus, is it possible that the top universities are biased towards people that, overall, get more reward in thinking about the future? Could we run a test to determine if &#8220;quality&#8221; of the school in terms of how hard it is to get in somehow correlates with being future oriented? Then we can take a look at, Duke&#8217;s population for example, and break it down even further. Are the kids that enjoy partying, study and do work at the last minute, more present oriented? Are the kids that preoccupy themselves and even sacrifice present happiness for some future goal or moment more future oriented? Do we just throw everyone else that doesn&#8217;t plan or party compulsively into the &#8220;then&#8221; category?<\/p>\n<p>Why did I ask this question? My thinking about time began with a bathroom stall in Sanford. Not in intending to use it, but in (questionably) accidentally finding it. I entered the building after a long run with an itch to re-explore its intricate and confusing architecture of stairs, people pockets, and inappropriately placed swiveling chairs. It seems that after all these years it hasn&#8217;t been high on the priority list to replace the print-out bathroom door labels with anything other than an 8.5\u20ac\u00b3 X 11,&#8221; (but at least they got an e-print!) so when I saw the one labeled &#8220;Women&#8221; on the second floor I figured I might ward off future discomfort by going now, since it was convenient.<\/p>\n<p>Closure is an elusive concept, and it is found in unexpected moments and ways. There are people and events in my life from which I still consciously hunger for closure, and ones that I don&#8217;t consciously think about, and then find it anyway. The second I stepped into this second floor bathroom the memory of a day in early February of 2007 flooded my memory. It was here that came after Pub Pol 55D with a pretty strange stomach ache that ultimately was catalyst for a surgery. This moment preceded huge physical and emotional pain, but I hadn&#8217;t known that, in that particular section of time. And it was amazing how quickly my mind placed me in that moment of discomfort, confusion, and uncertainty, and how, knowing what I presently knew, it was almost tragic to see my ignorant self about to cross into challenging times. Yet there was no thinking, analysis, or introspection beyond the memory of that feeling. Like the flick of a switch I conquered that moment. And in conquering that moment, I had conquered the entire experience. i had found closure, a feeling of peace and forgiveness towards the experience, almost like I looked the hairy beast from my past in the eyes, and did not avert my gaze. The moment was both powerful and humbling, and now the experience is best represented by the scar that it left. I am forever, visibly marked, but no longer vulnerable to the pain of the experience.<\/p>\n<p>The way in which my brain rewinded to that moment, started my thinking about time. I realized that my mind also has the ability to fast forward to a future moment that I predict will be wonderful, in comparison to what precedes it. Standing on the line at races, or right before an exam, I can mentally fast forward to the time after the race, after the exam, and before I know it, I am there. With regards to a long run, I don&#8217;t think about the distance or &#8220;what is left,&#8221; but instead see myself at the next interesting marker along the way, and then I&#8217;m there. But you have to be careful not to fast forward the entirety of life. It&#8217;s like a story that I heard as a child of a boy that was given a magical string &#8211; tugging the string accelerated time\u20ac\u00a6 so when it was spring he wanted it to be fall, when it was fall he again wanted spring, so before long he pulled his entire life away.<\/p>\n<p>I am a &#8220;when&#8221; that struggles with the insight of a &#8220;now.&#8221; I don&#8217;t talk a lot about how I perceive life and death, and the uncertainty of it all, mostly because I don&#8217;t think telling someone about experience is enough to change their life outlook beyond a knowledge perspective.

And before you make conclusions and analysis about this, let me explain, because I recognize that\u2019s a pretty dramatic statement to just throw out there. You see, our society places a huge expectation on marriage, and it is generally assumed (by most) that at some point in his\/her life there will be wedding bells and the like, when love is found. Society also creates an expectation of relationship, and through movies, TV shows, music, and the general media, glorifies and idealizes the experience of being in love, and the focus of having a boyfriend\/girlfriend\/significant other as part of a high quality life. And in this focus, most importantly, it makes individuals that don\u2019t have that, in the present moment, somehow feel inadequate. I\u2019m not saying that every single person feels inadequate, but I would speculate that the general mindset of the single person is to look for another half, whether proactively or not.\n\nI think this idea was pretty subconscious for me, just in the fact that I always assumed marriage, and that the cognition of never getting married, or never wanting\/needing to, never surfaced\u00a6 or let\u2019s think about it differently: completely remove any preference and just think about it like not being aware of one\u2019s relationship status. Even before I had any experience with romantic relationship, I assumed it charging down the track towards me. Can a life be valuable without the societal structure of a marriage? Maybe, maybe not, I\u2019ve never thought about it, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s less about the answer, (because I don\u2019t think that there is one) and more about the thought itself.\n\nWhat this assumption of couple-ness did for me, was make me slightly blind to the goodness of my reality. I would go even further to say that it affected the way that I viewed myself. I focused too much on what the opposite sex might think of me, how they might judge my style, my choices and thoughts. It\u2019s not that thinking about this isn\u2019t normal, but I think that the assumption or desire for relationship can make the levels off balance, tint our behavior and decisions, and not always in our favor. It can make us tilt towards cognitions that are more questioning and uncertain and away from ones that are more like this interaction\/thing\/person is AWESOME.\u009d Again, the focus is about valuing and enjoying what is\u009d as opposed to what should (and if you are an optimist probably will be) and then we convince ourselves that the happening-of\u009d that future moment is contingent upon our awareness of it in the present. It\u2019s largely not, and both experiences are best enjoyed when they are actually happening.\n\nMy friend and I talked about these two different experiences like baskets. Each one has its own flavorful, wonderful fruit, each to be enjoyed when the time is upon you, when its right. You run into trouble when you are sitting in one basket, and are focused or thinking about or subconsciously convinced that the fruit in the other basket might be better, and as a consequence you don\u2019t fully appreciate the flavors in the basket that you are sitting in.\n\nBack to me. I exist day-to-day, relishing in things like my endorphined-out runs, coming home after a busy day to my explosion of color where I sleep, and beautiful moments of solitariness when I can sit in my pajamas and lick peanut butter off my fingers and laugh out loud watching Scrubs. I can largely spend my time as I please, work when I feel like it, have moments of altruism, selfishness, social fireworks, and calming silence. I guess the realization came to me that life, today, right now, as I\u2019m writing this, in my present state, is really great, but it\u2019s hard to be aware of that.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think the fruits in the other basket might taste really great, and I do find it rewarding to indulge my frontal lobe in imagining their succulence, but my main focus should be where I\u2019m sitting. And there isn\u2019t any point in trying to compare the fruits. Think about a thought like running into an interesting person, reading a funny comic, or stepping on a rock tomorrow. It\u2019s not something that we have expectations about, but when it happens, we react to it. The same is true for love, careers, and all that. So when I say I don\u2019t have to get married,\u009d that doesn\u2019t imply a decision of shunning holy matrimony, now, at the ever-wise and omniscient age of 21 (note *sarcasm*). It implies letting it happen, if and when it does. This thought, in its meaning, in its simplicity, is incredibly powerful.\n\nSo enjoy it when it comes, but before it does, enjoy the now. Apply that to any domain of life, but it\u2019s best done broadly, I think. Deterring part of your focus to the expectation is like putting a clothes pin on your nostrils as you sit in your basket and munch away at your fruit. Becoming aware of the quality of your life right now is like ridding your nose of that pin, and tasting the present. All of a sudden the ambiguous, unidentifiable fruit explodes in robust tanginess and mysterious sweetness. If you don\u2019t taste your present fruit adequately you may (obviously) never fully enjoy the flavor, or react and jump up and down and discover that you can make juice or wine, and then in reaction to its flavor, lob it at someone passing by so they can try it too.\n\nAnd for the first time, how the fruit in the other basket might taste, or how we are told it will taste, doesn\u2019t even matter.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I had an epiphany two nights ago, that almost sent me into whoops, and it was simple.

Why? I\u2019m curious how my process compares to that of others, part of me wants to act as teacher, and then justify that for those who I have helped, I sometimes know what I\u2019m doing.\n\nUnfortunately I killed my earliest drafts, but we can start with what I have. We had to look at how mental disorder is depicted in the movies. I chose a Beautiful Mind, because it has Russell Crowe, of course\n\n**STEP 1: React and Make Connections**\n\n**1)** I made a blank doc that I made and just wrote shizoo down while I was watching, and reacting to what I saw. Then what I did is copy paste my class notes on schizophrenia into that doc, and then pair stuff I saw with the movie with what I learned. Then I created another doc, basically to ramble and put down my ideas, sorta diarrhea of the mind style. I don\u2019t have that original one because it turned into the main paper document (aka I saved over it) but what I did is copy paste stuff from this doc into the idea doc. So when I was done with this step, this particular document (JohnNashMovieNotes) was EMPTY!\n\n**STEP 2: Organize your Ramblings**\n\n2) I then made a doc that combines my ramblings (mostly my ramblings) with my observations\/notes. I started to chunk information into broad categories, and make connections between those categories. The idea is that finding connections gives your paper it\u2019s 1) theme(s) and 2) organization\/flow. While I was rambling, certain questions might have popped into my mind, and I would write them down, because investigating them might also lead to the foundation for a paper.\n\nThis is essentially the step of clumping ideas together and starting to answer the question what am I writing about anyway, what am i arguing? If you look at this document there is an idea of an outline at the top, and then highlighted yellow categories that might be a good order for that outline. So I essentially said what is my story? and then how am I going to tell it? But if you go beyond the yellow clumps! it\u2019s just TEXT TEXT TEXT! That\u2019s the ramblings.\n\nThis is probably the hardest part in writing a paper, when you have a general idea and know what you want to write about, you have some evidence, but no clue in hell-o how to put it all together. The way that I deal with this is by taking those broad yellow categories, (which are each important!) and thinking about how I might connect them. So even before tackling any paper meat, I write some potential transitions, and you\u2019ll see those under the yellow sections. I\u2019ve identified some idea buckets, and I\u2019m just trying to loosely tie some of them together. The next step is organization of the mass of paragraphs and ideas.\n\n**STEP 3: Put Rambles in Idea Buckets**\n\n3) The next step is going through those broad clumps of ideas, and just plopping them in an order and box that makes sense. So in this step, I\u2019m pairing the plot of the story with what might actually happen. This is when I put what I want to say broadly where I want to say it While I\u2019m doing this I\u2019m refining connections, maybe deciding that one category isn\u2019t in the right spot, and also writing spur of the moment! new ideas even come to me and i say AHA, this needs to be added, and most of the time I even refine my thesis with these new ideas. I say thesis, you ask, where did that come from? I feel that the thesis comes to you as you are making connections, and grows with the paper. For me, it started with something like (the movie ties schizophrenia to brilliance) then I thought about how it shows John as being in control of his treatment, how environment, stress, came into play, and thinking about those things in relation to the paper prompt \u2013 the thesis just emerges, really, I couldn\u2019t tell you when! I think it comes early like a bud and matures with the thinking.\n\nIn terms of actual process, I literally draw a bold line below my yellow outline, above the mass of words, and start cutting from below and pasting above. When the space below the line is empty, I\u2019m done with this step. You\u2019ll also notice stuff in red, which is either instructions or notes to myself, to remember for the next step.\n\n\u20ac\u201cThis\u20ac\u201c is a slightly later version of placing ramblings in idea buckets.\n\n**STEP 4: Paperize It!**\n\n4) The next part is easier. The organization, transitions (flow of ideas) is basically done, now you have to prune and refine. Yes, you have to actually! write the paper! (because a lot of the result of step 3 is just organized ramblings, it isn\u2019t actually paper quality). So I tackle one yellow section at a time, and do the same writing\/copy\/pasting combo again, but more on a detail level. Now I care how the idea is said, (word choice, sentence structure), having the RIGHT transitions, topic sentences! ALL the details basically. I also check the balance of the introduction and the conclusion, and make sure that everything that\u2019s in the paper is found there. The introduction should provide just the right amount to set up the story but not give everything away, and the conclusion has a little extra oomph at the end to leave the reader satisfied, but possibly create an appetite to ask more questions. So in this step there will also be a lot of deletion (why it went from 12 single spaced to 8 double spaced pages, sans references and title page). Historically (since maybe 2nd grade), my problem has never been meeting the page requirement and needing to write more, I have always been presented with the problem of cutting out what I don\u2019t need. Dude, just look at my blog, you know this about me I only prune when I have to \u2013 like for work or academic things, because getting a point across quickly and directly is important! But not for free writing.\n\nWhen you are sifting through evidence, the decision to include or not is more than just asking is it good? I ask, given the context of what I\u2019m trying to prove or say, does it add nothing? too little? or maybe I\u2019ve already hammered the point, and have enough.\n\nAs I finish writing each yellow section, I\u2019ll make it double spaced so it actually LOOKS like a paper. That\u2019s like my little reward for finishing a section\n\nThen you have a first draft. WOOT!! I\u2019ll give it a day to steep, read it over, and make little corrections like I\u2019m reading someone else\u2019s paper. This is also the stage when anyone else might see it, if I want feedback. As my family knows, I usually send it to them, to look for the mispellings and commas that I missed. Honestly, at this point I get lazy and feel like the cost of marginal work outweighs the benefits. Largely, I don\u2019t seek other people reading it. So I do the minimum to finalize it. I\u2019m glad my family, if they get back to me with anything more than a woo!! is pretty chill about editing, otherwise I\u2019d have to do more work.\n\n**STEP 5: Make pretty, and print**\n\nThen you have a \u201cfinal\u201d (haha, it\u2019s not actually due yet, as I post this). I just fixed little things, added the citations and correct formatting (title page, references, page numbers), and I\u2019m done. yay. The best part is emailing a copy to, myself, to print via e-print when I need it. Shaaweet!\n\nHow does that compare to what you do? It\u2019s not that I plan this out in advance, it just happens and I tried to articulate it this time. Hope it was interesting.\n\n\n","html":"<p>OK, so I&#8217;m in the process of writing a final paper, and i thought it would be cool to share how I go about that.  Why?

I would like to propose a new hypothesis for most mental disorder: I think that ALL mental disorder is the result of an inability to adapt quickly enough to change. It is akin to limping when you hurt your leg, it is what you get from a brain in the process of mending itself.\n\nOur brain\u201ds are like muscles, sensitive and reactant to being used and what they are exposed to. When a stress is placed on a muscle or bone that is greater than its capacity to handle it, you get an injury. There is damage, or change in the tissue, that needs time to heal. It doesn\u201dt matter how you get it \u2013 the injury might be incurred slowly over time, as an athlete develops a stress fracture, or happen suddenly, like snapping something in half. Ouch. Either way, the healing is a must to \u201cadapt.\u201d\u009d And no, we won\u201dt always heal and be exactly the same as before, but the body will fix itself in the best way it knows how, to achieve balance again. Our bodies are really good at that balance thing\n\nIt isn\u201dt so surprising that so much of mental disorder occurs in concordance or after change, namely stressful life events, whether positive or negative, or forced changes in behavior. I would say that a lot of disorder comes from a forced change in behavior as a result of a change in life circumstances.\n\nOur body has these systems as ways of telling us that we need to change our behavior to find balance again \u2013 it isn\u201dt aware of the resultant behavioral effects on the body \u2013 the effects and consequences of change and adaptation, when they are noticeably large, are \u201cmental disorder.\u201d\u009d Our body alters us to changes in the environment with things like pain and temperature, reactions to motion, color, and sound, through cravings what food we might need, aversion to things that made us sick, or even when it\u201ds time to sleep and we feel tired. A lot of life is about listening and reacting to the demands of your body, when you think about it. These cues are more somatic and therefore \u201cobvious\u201d\u009d than something like a \u201cgut feeling,\u201d\u009d which I would argue is just as informationally rich and salient.\n\nSo what happens when we have an injury and go against these responses? The injury gets chronic: it doesn\u201dt heal. The same is true for mental illness. From a neurobiological perspective, it\u201ds probably time needed for rewiring. As life demands change, our brains change too to make new connections, and prune ones that aren\u201dt as important anymore. When a life event occurs that demands a change that is too big or fast for us to handle, this is when disorder sets in: when the brain is unable to process the new demand. Perhaps a change might happen so quickly that one area of the brain is fundamentally changed, and then other areas must form new connections or \u201cgrow around\u201d\u009d that new change.\n\n**Why do many current methods of treatment \u201cwork\u201d\u009d?**\n\nSo why does something like psychotherapy, or drugs, or even time alleviate disorder? It either helps to speed adaptation, fill in a missing piece, or facilitate connections. Of course it is possible to have instances when the brain has been stressed to a degree that would require extreme time or change to \u201creturn to balance\u201d\u009d and I think that there are circumstances when the brain simply cannot adapt, and goes into complete dysfunction.\n\nIt would be interesting to focus in on specific disorders, and think about them as the brain adapting to some change. I would imagine that different levels of damage require different times, you could perhaps try to study time with relation to each disorder? Treatment might be more about best managing that time, maybe accelerating it with psychotherapy, or encouraging\/facilitating connections with medication. The CORE of this treatment might be focused around what caused the damage and how severe it is, how to protect the brain during healing, and ways to best promote recovery.\n\nAnd then what is balance between \u201cslapping on a bandaid\u201d\u009d (so treating symptoms to promote current happiness and ability to exist in society) vs. leaving the brain be and letting it adapt, or tending to underlying injury? How do we deal with the demand for functionality when it might go against healing? It probably depends on the disorder, as I would imagine there might be some that require so much time that it makes most sense to treat those symptoms and focus on the present. That\u201ds a pretty broad and challenging question, and I don\u201dt have an answer.\n\n**Mental Disorder: My Equation**\n\nMental disorder is at the core, neuro-biological, and is the body\u201ds inability to adapt to change, or reaction to a change that is too sudden to adapt to. Here is a summation!\n\nMental disorder = change (in external environment (diathesis) that demands brain to adapt (reward system, stress, etc) at a speed that is TOO fast for the normal creation of neurons, wiring (pruning, growth, etc). Then we are encouraged to act in ways to protect this vulnerability and promote healing.\n\nDiathesis that demands change \u2013> inability to adapt (shock) \u2013> change in behavior cognition to promote healing\n\nor a simplified version\n\n**Change \u2013> brain as deer in headlights \u2013> Reaction**\n\n**What does this mean about our expectation of change?**\n\nExpectation might be a good thing. When we EXPECT change, that is almost giving our brains a heads up, to either start adapting early, be better prepared for the shock, or think of ways to avoid it. Expectation can also be dangerous for disorders for which the brain might need a lot more time to heal. For someone with schizophrenia, hope is lost after 1, 2, 5, 10 years, but what if that adaptation just takes a lot longer, yet we place some sort of time expectancy on it, and get our hopes up? The same goes with depression, anxiety, mood, or body image disorder \u2013 when we create some sort of expectation around the timing of getting better, that can\u201dt be great for treatment\u201d\u00a6 We attribute a patient waking up from a long coma as a \u201cmiracle,\u201d\u009d but suggests that our brains can heal, we just have no idea about the timing. Isn\u201dt it the same for mental illness? Think of it as a spectrum of time needed to heal, something like coma on the far extreme right, something like a bad day on the less extreme left side\u201d\u00a6 everything might fall somewhere along that spectrum.\n\n**What does this mean for how we view mental disorder?**\n\nI\u201dm not sure what to do with this idea, but I think that it has huge implications to change the way that we view mental disorder. I am thinking that my idea can be taken from a public policy standpoint, it might be an idea that can be good because if \u201cspread\u201d\u009d it might change the way people think about mental illness and consequently how the mentally ill are treated, thought about, or it could take a more treatment-specific spin.\n\nIt could be woven into hypotheses about what the brain looks like \u201cbefore and after\u201d\u009d for specific disorders, or maybe something as simple as the brain\u201ds response to getting hurt, and the timing of that response, and how its correlated with changes in thinking and behavior, and based on that timing, what are the best treatment options\/implication for treatment? Or the worlds of public policy and science might make some combined effort: start in the lab, get some results, and use those results to influence public\u201ds perception\/idea of mental illness.\n\nCan we err away from words like \u201ccrazy,\u201d\u009d \u201cpsycho\u201d\u009d and move towards something a little more sympathic, a little more human? Falling and breaking your hand and going to see Dr. Handsy sure comes with a lot less negative stigma than talking with a \u201cshrink.\u201d\u009d It\u201ds just harder to look at any sort of maladaptive behavior in the same way as an injury gushing out blood and rocks. What\u201ds the difference? We give a lot more value to pain that we can see, even though in both cases it is our body\u201ds way of alerting us that something needs healing\/adaptation. The funny thing is that in both cases the experience of \u201ccrap, something is off\u201d\u009d goes on in our heads. At the same time it might make it very easy to \u201cpretend,\u201d\u009d and use that for manipulation, and knowing that leads to even more skepticism. How do we distinguish the two?\n\n**Where does the negative stigma come to begin with?** Many behaviors of those with mental booboos are very noticeable and unacceptable in the eyes of society, and that lack of acceptance only serves to alienate those with mental illness even further.\n\n**Final Point \u2013 Have compassion for the brain.**\n\nGive your noggin a little more flexibility to get hurt, and have more acceptance when it does. In essence, mental illness is less a negative thing, or something being \u201cwrong\u201d\u009d with the person, and more a brain booboo that needs time to heal.\n\n\n","html":"<p>This second semester I took Abnormal Psychology, and spurred my thinking about mental disorder. I would like to propose a new hypothesis for most mental disorder: I think that ALL mental disorder is the result of an inability to adapt quickly enough to change. It is akin to limping when you hurt your leg, it is what you get from a brain in the process of mending itself.<\/p>\n<p>Our brain&#8221;s are like muscles, sensitive and reactant to being used and what they are exposed to. When a stress is placed on a muscle or bone that is greater than its capacity to handle it, you get an injury. There is damage, or change in the tissue, that needs time to heal. It doesn&#8221;t matter how you get it &#8211; the injury might be incurred slowly over time, as an athlete develops a stress fracture, or happen suddenly, like snapping something in half. Ouch. Either way, the healing is a must to &#8220;adapt.&#8221;\u009d And no, we won&#8221;t always heal and be exactly the same as before, but the body will fix itself in the best way it knows how, to achieve balance again. Our bodies are really good at that balance thing<\/p>\n<p>It isn&#8221;t so surprising that so much of mental disorder occurs in concordance or after change, namely stressful life events, whether positive or negative, or forced changes in behavior. I would say that a lot of disorder comes from a forced change in behavior as a result of a change in life circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Our body has these systems as ways of telling us that we need to change our behavior to find balance again &#8211; it isn&#8221;t aware of the resultant behavioral effects on the body &#8211; the effects and consequences of change and adaptation, when they are noticeably large, are &#8220;mental disorder.&#8221;\u009d Our body alters us to changes in the environment with things like pain and temperature, reactions to motion, color, and sound, through cravings what food we might need, aversion to things that made us sick, or even when it&#8221;s time to sleep and we feel tired. A lot of life is about listening and reacting to the demands of your body, when you think about it. These cues are more somatic and therefore &#8220;obvious&#8221;\u009d than something like a &#8220;gut feeling,&#8221;\u009d which I would argue is just as informationally rich and salient.<\/p>\n<p>So what happens when we have an injury and go against these responses? The injury gets chronic: it doesn&#8221;t heal. The same is true for mental illness. From a neurobiological perspective, it&#8221;s probably time needed for rewiring. As life demands change, our brains change too to make new connections, and prune ones that aren&#8221;t as important anymore. When a life event occurs that demands a change that is too big or fast for us to handle, this is when disorder sets in: when the brain is unable to process the new demand. Perhaps a change might happen so quickly that one area of the brain is fundamentally changed, and then other areas must form new connections or &#8220;grow around&#8221;\u009d that new change.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do many current methods of treatment &#8220;work&#8221;\u009d?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So why does something like psychotherapy, or drugs, or even time alleviate disorder? It either helps to speed adaptation, fill in a missing piece, or facilitate connections. Of course it is possible to have instances when the brain has been stressed to a degree that would require extreme time or change to &#8220;return to balance&#8221;\u009d and I think that there are circumstances when the brain simply cannot adapt, and goes into complete dysfunction.<\/p>\n<p>It would be interesting to focus in on specific disorders, and think about them as the brain adapting to some change. I would imagine that different levels of damage require different times, you could perhaps try to study time with relation to each disorder? Treatment might be more about best managing that time, maybe accelerating it with psychotherapy, or encouraging\/facilitating connections with medication. The CORE of this treatment might be focused around what caused the damage and how severe it is, how to protect the brain during healing, and ways to best promote recovery.<\/p>\n<p>And then what is balance between &#8220;slapping on a bandaid&#8221;\u009d (so treating symptoms to promote current happiness and ability to exist in society) vs. leaving the brain be and letting it adapt, or tending to underlying injury? How do we deal with the demand for functionality when it might go against healing? It probably depends on the disorder, as I would imagine there might be some that require so much time that it makes most sense to treat those symptoms and focus on the present. That&#8221;s a pretty broad and challenging question, and I don&#8221;t have an answer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mental Disorder: My Equation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mental disorder is at the core, neuro-biological, and is the body&#8221;s inability to adapt to change, or reaction to a change that is too sudden to adapt to.

I think that we are in less control of our behavior than we think, and that most of our action is us simply responding to our environment. No, I\u2019m not going to globally say that free choice is an illusion, but it\u2019s twanged back and forth by a lot of external rubber bands. There are activities that we might do and find very fulfilling, but little hurdles might get in the way of those things. The interesting thing is that environment can be set up in a way that we aren\u2019t even aware of the hurdles, or what is behind them.\n\nLet\u2019s call these not so lovely lumps **Incentive Barriers**: small things in our environment, whether consciously chosen by the individual or whoever has altered the environment, that are a disincentive for behavior. An incentive barrier is a small \u201churdle\u201d\u009d that prevents us from engaging in a behavior or activity that might be very rewarding. It is a blockade to the \u201ccatalyst.\u201d\u009d I think that identifying these barriers and sanding them down a bit might lead to a more fulfilling daily existence.\n\nThis idea might best be explained through examples. These are some I\u2019ve taken notice of, and I\u2019m sure you could think of some of your own!\n\n**Bike Rides and Stairways:** I love riding my bike. At Amherst I lived on a first floor dorm and went for a ride every day. I went on a long solo trip this past Fall, and excitedly brought my bike to Duke. I\u2019ve taken maybe a handful of rides, for the entirety of my stay here. Why is that?\n\n* Time? Heck no, I always have at least a few hours in the day that I fill with nonsense that I enjoy Plus, things that I want to do, I make time for.\n\n* Riding Conditions?: Slightly yes. There isn\u2019t as easy access to biking routes here as there was at Amherst, but what is most telling to me is that once I\u2019ve gotten out there, I\u2019ve enjoyed it immensely, and always wondered what was bringing down the frequency of my getting out.\n\n* The real answer: Is so small, and so simple. The annoyance of carrying my bike down the stairs, or through a door, is enough to not go on rides at all. It\u2019s not so much the lifting, but the turning of corners, and having to hold the door while lifting it up stairs and into a small space. It seems silly doesn\u2019t it? But I dreaded that tiny part of the process so much, that it was a barrier to doing it all together. And I was so concerned about pieces of my bike getting stolen that I wasn\u2019t too keen on locking it up outside. Funny how in an attempt to protect my property, I wind up not enjoying its use at all.\n\n**What do I learn from this?**\n\nI can make changes in my environment to break down this incentive barrier. On a large scale, what I\u2019ve learned is that wherever I live, I want easy access to biking places, and if I don\u2019t live on a first floor, I want a garage or a safe place to store a bike for which it is also easy to take it out. For next semester, given that I live on the third floor, it means sucking it up and putting my bike out on a rack, and getting all the right locks and such to make myself feel better about it being \u201cinsecure.\u201d\u009d It\u2019s about balancing the joy I get from my rides with the risk of my bike being tampered with. What is the monetary value that I place on the joy of one ride, and what might it cost to replace a seat? a wheel?\n\n**Convenience Eating up Experience:**\n\nA lot of little things in life that are \u201ceasier\u201d\u009d or \u201cmore convenient,\u201d\u009d that mentally seem light a great idea, might actually eat away at life experience. For example, I would call the Duke buses an incentive barrier from walking through the gardens, or possibly biking or trotting over to central or west campus. When you either are forced to or force yourself to do it, and it isn\u2019t a regular part of your life, it\u2019s usually a very beautiful walk. But since the buses are \u2013 there \u2013 and the most logical way to get from point A to point B, the other options don\u2019t even come to mind. And how can a busy student justify taking extra time to not be productive and just walk?\n\nWhen I come back to my apartment and my laptop is open the ease of connectivity or \u201ccommunicate\u201d\u009d with people online makes the alternative not happen. How about having a computer, and internet\/email, period? Take that ease a step further with an iphone. It\u2019s so easy, but is it better? When is the last time you wrote a paper letter, delivered it in person, or went to visit a friend to talk over email or AIM (which, thanks to gmail, are one and the same). Remember life when we didn\u2019t have this technology? Is it better now?\n\n**What do I learn from this?**\n\nWhenever I feel a strong desire to not do something, or a stronger one to engage in a behavior, I ask myself why, and if the reason doesn\u2019t make me squirmy (like no, I\u2019m not going to walk through the gardens at 2:00 in the morning alone, I\u2019d bring a friend to feel more secure) then I might think if there are other ways to \u201caccomplish\u201d\u009d the same thing. Then I might pick one of the other alternatives, just to try it out, and compare experience and not \u201crationality.\u201d\u009d\n\nOpportunity: An opportunity is like a leak, or a hole in the fabric of your everyday environment that lets you engage in behavior that might have been harder to do before. Essentially, it is the lowering of a barrier. This is why an open door might be more of an invitation to robbery than a closed one, a dinner date or night out only happens when the invitation or car ride is presented to you, and reading an inspiring book or getting an email about an internship, project, etc, motivates you to engage in it. All of these things are arguably always available to us, but when it is up to us to provide both the thought of doing it, the catalyst, and then the follow through, it\u2019s a lot harder. This is probably why in friend and even work groups you have your \u201cthinkers,\u201d\u009d that propose or present the idea, your \u201cengage-ers\u201d\u009d that keep the catalyst going until the reaction starts, and then the \u201cdo-ers\u201d\u009d that jump in, keep the party going and are the ingredients to the entire recipe of experience.\n\nAnd here are some \u201cdecisions\u201d\u009d that I mad that were largely reactions to my environment.\n\nDropped contact lens \u2013> decided that it was a good time to open a new pair\n\nmy legs hurt \u2013> time for new shoes\n\nhave to go to bathroom \u2013> decide to pack up and leave library\n\nThe same goes for moods \u2013 someone smiling at me makes me smile \u2013> I feel happy, and then I might attribute it to a choice or something i consciously did.\n\nI have a mental list of these \u2013 I\u2019ll hold back from being a dork and including them all, you get the idea!!\n\nThe important takeaway is that you might identify and tweak tiny barriers to alter your behavior. And just as there are BARRIERS, there are also TRIGGERS. So create barriers for things you don\u2019t want in your life, because they make you experience what my Dad likes to call a \u201csuckfest,\u201d\u009d and knock them down for things that might make you smile. And I think that enough crappy stuff will happen \u201cnaturally\u201d\u009d to provide that valuable contrast of experience, but it\u2019s OK to be a little selfish and want encourage a life made of more positive puzzle pieces.\n\nFor my own life? After making all these observations, and realizing how prominent environment is on everyday behavior, I can imagine that when I make any grand or minuscule choice, I will think hugely about the environment and how I might interact with it on a daily basis. I\u2019ll never take a \u201cdream job\u201d\u009d in a nasty city without those running and bike paths, and I\u2019ll cut suckfesters from my life that make me feel crappy. I\u2019ve gotten ahead of myself in mentioning people \u2013 you might apply this idea of environment affecting behavior to people as well. People that you choose (or like) to be around have a ginormous impact on your behavior, and consequently, how you view and feel about yourself. For another time.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about how environment is directly related to action.

This is probably why in friend and even work groups you have your &#8220;thinkers,&#8221;\u009d that propose or present the idea, your &#8220;engage-ers&#8221;\u009d that keep the catalyst going until the reaction starts, and then the &#8220;do-ers&#8221;\u009d that jump in, keep the party going and are the ingredients to the entire recipe of experience.<\/p>\n<p>And here are some &#8220;decisions&#8221;\u009d that I mad that were largely reactions to my environment.<\/p>\n<p>Dropped contact lens &#8211;> decided that it was a good time to open a new pair<\/p>\n<p>my legs hurt &#8211;> time for new shoes<\/p>\n<p>have to go to bathroom &#8211;> decide to pack up and leave library<\/p>\n<p>The same goes for moods &#8211; someone smiling at me makes me smile &#8211;> I feel happy, and then I might attribute it to a choice or something i consciously did.<\/p>\n<p>I have a mental list of these &#8211; I&#8217;ll hold back from being a dork and including them all, you get the idea!!<\/p>\n<p>The important takeaway is that you might identify and tweak tiny barriers to alter your behavior. And just as there are BARRIERS, there are also TRIGGERS. So create barriers for things you don&#8217;t want in your life, because they make you experience what my Dad likes to call a &#8220;suckfest,&#8221;\u009d and knock them down for things that might make you smile. And I think that enough crappy stuff will happen &#8220;naturally&#8221;\u009d to provide that valuable contrast of experience, but it&#8217;s OK to be a little selfish and want encourage a life made of more positive puzzle pieces.<\/p>\n<p>For my own life? After making all these observations, and realizing how prominent environment is on everyday behavior, I can imagine that when I make any grand or minuscule choice, I will think hugely about the environment and how I might interact with it on a daily basis. I&#8217;ll never take a &#8220;dream job&#8221;\u009d in a nasty city without those running and bike paths, and I&#8217;ll cut suckfesters from my life that make me feel crappy. I&#8217;ve gotten ahead of myself in mentioning people &#8211; you might apply this idea of environment affecting behavior to people as well. People that you choose (or like) to be around have a ginormous impact on your behavior, and consequently, how you view and feel about yourself.

I\u2019ve been getting accustomed to pursuing what makes me happy on a daily basis, but for the longest time, unable to apply this thinking when considering the future. It\u2019s taken years of being pulled and stretched to finally be able to do this. And for the first time in my life, I feel what I might call a solid future footing, or an inner peace that completes my sense of self or identity.\n\n**A JOURNEY:** I\u2019ll describe the path that I\u2019ve taken at Duke to come to this place. It\u2019s been really hard. I\u2019ve been anxious, sad, and confused at times, lost and then under and illusion of guidance. I came here not knowing much about myself other than I was talented at a lot of things, and needed to do a lot of exploration to figure out which talent might further, make me most happy. I\u2019d say that the hardest thing about having what motivational psychologists call a \u201cneed for cognition\u201d\u009d in the domain of the self, and then being a pretty competent person in many skills is that at some point, breadth must turn to depth. What we commonly forget is that there is a difference between being good at something and being electrified by something. We commonly take a liking to things we are good at because it gives us a high feeling of self efficacy, but it may not define us. Then when we are good at something, and others regard it highly, we force ourselves into areas for the wrong reasons. Hello midlife crisis, or if you never get the insight followed by guts to be true to yourself, consistent unhappiness.\n\nI discovered early on that I was fascinated by people and behavior, and after stomping around in the econ\/ public policy puddle I finally made the choice to screw everything else and just study psychology. I perceived this to be a dangerous choice at the time because it didn\u2019t fall in line with any clear career line. As much as I loved the study, I knew (from working at a desk) that I would never be happy in a desk job, and that I just didn\u2019t want to be a psychologist.\n\nCan\u2019t select the right one? Get rid of the wrong ones. During my time at Duke, I\u2019ve largely been trying things to see how much I like them. Sometimes, the easiest way to find what you like is to figure out what you don\u2019t like. Here are some big things that I narrowed down.\n\n**BIG THING #1:** There is a lot of hoopla and press about this \u201cresearch\u201d\u009d thing. I mean oh my goodness, it\u2019s what every good undergrad does, if you aren\u2019t doing research in your chosen field then- FAIL! I tried strictly literature-digging research, twice actually, and ultimately went insane from working at a desk, and feeling forced to work in one flavor, with not enough creative outlet. It was\u2026 BORING! I also encountered many professors and students that think very highly of themselves. Heck, one even fashioned himself into a sort of brand. At first, I was impressed, maybe after talking with him\/her once or twice. But what I realized, slowly over time, is that these people weren\u2019t so fun or brilliant, they simply said the same things over and over again, and massaged their egos to some sort of intellectual orgasm. The more I encountered this type of person, the more I felt sick to my stomach, and sure that I never wanted to be like that. It\u2019s much more attractive to be a brilliant force, behind the scene, with a fire fueled by the love of the work or content as opposed to the love of being in the spotlight. Moving on.\n\n**BIG THING #2:** The next \u201cbig thing\u201d that every person at a place like Duke is forced to consider is what I might call this startup bug. It\u2019s the sexiest thing to start your own business, and given the trend, it better have something to do with technology, something mobile, or something green. I had a lot of fun with this path, I must admit, but at the end of the day? My incentives and motives were completely based on the people I was working with, feeling like part of a team and having fun being united by the same goal. We could have been designing a new rubber-band or packaging turds, once the people component turned negative, so did the experience for me. I\u2019m not against entrepreneurship, it is very much a path I could be following maybe 15 years into the future, but it has to be in the right domain.\n\n**BIG THING #3:** Fall of senior year comes with a lot of \u201cohmygodI\u2019mabouttograduateIneedaJOB\u201d\u009d stress. Hello career fairs, e-recruiting, and submitting a lot of resumes to companies you aren\u2019t sure what the hell you\u2019d be doing. But why did I do it? Because obtaining a tangible job would give me guaranteed future success, stability, and look good to other people. Phew, right? No, not right. In the storm of anxiety I interviewed for consulting and research jobs, even did a case challenge competition, and attended every information session and panel that was available. It was in mid conversation with a partner from Deloitte when I realized, \u201cwow, this guy is a douchebag. Being a consultant might make a lot of money, but when it comes down to it, it\u2019s being a professional @ss kisser.\u009d The thought of me being in that job role, again, made me sick to my stomach. I also went to a \u201cwomen\u2019s dessert event\u201d\u009d and realized that I had absolutely nothing in common with these women, and found them a little boring, actually. Later consulting. It is a blessing in disguise that the one job at facebook that I DID interview for, I wasn\u2019t offered. You can ask my friend Sam, before decisions were out, I was hoping that I wouldn\u2019t get the offer to make the choice easier for me.\n\nThe social pressures of an institution can be distracting and sometimes louder than your internal voice. What happened is that this stream of exploding seniors made me forget that I would never be happy working at a desk. Once I remembered that (actually when I visited Palo Alto and saw all the little lemmings typety typety at their desks) I was quick to just cancel the rest of the desk jobs I was going to interview for. Doing so would be a waste of BOTH of our time.\n\nDon\u2019t pigeon hole your options for lame reasons: It was after this thought process that I realized that my squirminess with regards to my future wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t have something secured. I realized that, had I secured any of those jobs, the squirminess would have gotten worse. I realized that I was anxious and spending hours and hours mindlessly browsing easy opportunities, jobs, and graduate schools because I was severely limiting my options. The best thing for me, what my heart really wanted, I wasn\u2019t even putting out there as an option. This is a disease of Duke: this feeling that, given I went to this school, I have to either get a REALLY GOOD job, pursue some form of graduate study (preferably in something sciencey, if you want to go for something like English or History \u2013 FAIL!) or go out and save the world, in a social or teaching sense.\n\nWe shuffle towards paths that are most accessible: I think that the majority of kids don\u2019t really know what electrifies them, so it\u2019s easy to latch on to options that are available, and seem do-able. A lot of graduate school (not all, mind you, but a lot) is probably pursued out of prolonging indecision, I think. It\u2019s like, oh @#$%, I\u2019m not really sure about what I want to do, but I can take these pre-reqs for med school, I can study for this test, and I know I can apply, hopefully get in somewhere, and then secure a future with financial and reputation-al prestige and security. I\u2019m not saying that this is true for everyone \u2013 I\u2019m sure that there are a group of kids out there that are electrified by the profession of medicine or law. I am just noticing a disproportionately large percentage of the student body that is enrolled along one of these courses, sometimes as a \u201clast minute\u201d\u009d decision, other times as a \u201cwell I declared it, and now I can\u2019t take it back or people will think I suck,\u00c3\u00a2\u201d or \u201check, I\u2019m not sure what else I\u2019d do, this seems OK for now,\u201d\u009d thing. Or maybe they really are convinced it\u2019s their calling, and it might be. But once you jump on one of those wagons, Phew, your future is set, and it feels good now. If that\u2019s the case, why aren\u2019t people happier here? Time to make sacrifices now for that lofty future, because you might be happier then, right? On a tangent, we have this idea that given OK health, I am guaranteed a long life, and tomorrow is there. I\u2019m of the mindset that the cancer patient is pretty much on par with you, me, no one is assured of longevity of life, the difference is having an idea about how much time you have left, and in that case, I could make an argument for wanting to be and not wanting to be the cancer patient. Anyway, back to the Duke undergrad. Okay, I\u2019m pre- med! law! If not that, graduate school! research! If not that -must\u2026 get\u2026 job! beyond that, can I really call myself a Duke graduate? I have this perception that given a certain income, title, or life-path, that will make me happy. Errrm, probably not. I think happiness is more of a personality trait that changes in degree with regards to the situation that you choose, but that\u2019s another bucket of ladybugs.\n\nIn the domain of being true to yourself, Duke is a dangerous place. I would say that there is pressure, or even a disease, to be highly successful and achieving in the eyes of others. From the point of being accepted here to constantly being submerged in this murky pool of huge competition and academic arrogance, most of us develop (consciously or unconsciously) a feeling that, given I went to this school, I expect a certain salary, life outcome, certainty of success, once I am released. Also when you are here, if you didn\u2019t already have it from high school, we further develop our fear of failure. I can\u2019t tell you how many of my friends, who have the work ethic and drive to be successful, are terrified of not getting into graduate school, medical school, law school, or even getting a job or having some clear path after graduation. Heck, that\u2019s been me this Fall. Hold up. First of all, there will always be opportunity for you given that you graduate college, let alone a brand name school like Duke. Wrong perspective. Too black and white. If you are unemployed for a year or go out and try something completely crazy, that\u2019s OK. Not being perfect at everything doesn\u2019t switchback to failure, and neither does maintaining some path of career certainty. It is possible to do something and not be perfect or the best and be happy. The problem here is that we perceive \u201cnot-complete success\u201d as failure. There is this feeling that if you aren\u2019t making a solid 60-100K upon graduation or are on a path to make more than that, you\u2019re a waste. And if you are electrified by something that doesn\u2019t fit in that box? Better go on salary.com and find a way to make it fit. Sucks!\n\nIt\u2019s all so silly, we can smile about that: Guys, do you realize how silly all of this is? It might be me, but once I reached senior year, I started to look around and everyone looked really young. And the way that kids stress, work themselves to the core, and then drink like sailors is just silly. Given that I place a high emphasis on what others think of me, do I really care that much what an 18 year old thinks about my choices? Do I really need to be concerned with how attractive I come across to these gawky self-centered frat boys? Nope! When it comes down to it, every single person here is just that, a person, and in the same boat of being in some stage in the process of self discovery. We\u2019re all sticking our toes in different puddles to test the temperature and are a little confused. This entire campus culture, pressure to succeed, make sacrifices, not be true to yourself, is just so ridiculous. I\u2019m not sure what the administration is up to. No, adding flat screen TVs to unnecessary places doesn\u2019t make people happier, or doing construction to make the campus even more impressive and uncomfortable, sorry!\n\nSo in this mindset, I\u2019ve relaxed a lot. I\u2019m not so worried about what other people think that I\u2019m doing, I sort of just do what moves me. It feels wonderful, and it feels free, but getting here was a huge suckfest. I am certain that I\u2019ve been force to deal with things that most don\u2019t even consider until later life. But in order to learn, and in order to grow, you have to survive adversity and make it through challenge. Nothing will ever be learned from a life of safety, privilege, acceptance, and easiness.\n\n**The Suckfest:** Along this line of self discovery I had three large buckets of bad things poured on me. I had my heart elated and broken, I had three nasty surgeries that made me realize that life was no guarantee, and I had an identity stomp when I stopped running competitively. Let me summarize what I learned.\n\n**1)** I learned that I have to pursue and put energy into the people, things, activities, and ideas that make me happy, regardless of others, because at the end of the day, the one person I have to report to is myself, and it\u2019s always the case that when I feel anxiety or unhappy about something I haven\u2019t stayed true to myself. What does this mean? It means really following your heart, and not just convincing yourself that you are. It means not changing your style of dress, behavior, or personality to be better liked. It means dropping people from your life that make you feel crappy, and surrounding yourself with people that make you feel good. In terms of my running, it had lost its previous passion because I was running for everyone but myself. As soon as I left the team I gradually re-found the fulfillment that was lost. It\u2019s a little contradictory, but I now run more than I ever have, and I love it.\n\n**2)** I learned that communication and honesty are always the best policy. It\u2019s a good and a bad thing to have a very thin filter between my mind and my lips, but I figure that anyone who is offended by my thought content and style probably isn\u2019t a good friend match anyway. I also appreciate people who are open and honest with me, who I perceive to be more \u201creal.\u201d\u009d\n\n**3)** I know that I score highly on this personality dimension called the \u201cneed to belong.\u201d\u009d I am most fulfilled by connecting with people, by making them happy. If you want to make me really happy, make me a part of something you are doing, or come along with me in something I\u2019m doing. If you want to hurt me, do something that alienates me, is dishonest, or manipulative. A few times of hurt, I can forgive and move on, but I know myself well, and there is a certain line of squirminess that people can cross when I feel the automatic necessity to make a social cut.\n\n**4)** Having someone to love was like this forbidden fruit, that once I lost it, not only was the rejection painful, I wanted it back and felt incomplete without it. I realized through this process that life is most fulfilling when you are whole in yourself, and having something like a relationship isn\u2019t even necessary. It sucks that society sends a prominent message that being single is akin to being incomplete, and that you should want a relationship. I can\u2019t say either way whether I will stumble upon this love thing again, but I am certain that I don\u2019t need it to be happy, and that when and if it comes along, I\u2019ll just know it. And I am of the mindset that I will not change, or feel like I need to, for anyone. And given the pressure from society, the media, it\u2019s pretty common to evaluate the people that are currently in your life and try to pick the best one, and even potentially obsess or force something that isn\u2019t there. DON\u2019T DO IT! I feel like I will either know, it will happen naturally, and if I\u2019m unaware of a potential interest, if the guy in interested enough, he will put in the energy. I\u2019m a strong believer that if the guy doesn\u2019t have the energy or balls to pursue me, he\u2019s probably not interested enough in the first place. Bottom line is that friends are amazing. I will always be socially healthy when I pursue and feed good friendships.\n\n**5)** Be good to yourself. You won\u2019t always be in good spirits, and you don\u2019t always have to smile. I find it refreshing to be pissed now and then >:P It\u2019s OK to value or fall into your neutral and negative moments as it is your positive. It is in the days of high negative emotion that you need to be better to yourself. I even sometimes go as far as to view myself as another person, and make decisions about how to treat myself based on that. I felt crappy the other morning, so I went to the state park. I\u2019m also a firm believer in doing what you want when you feel like it. I manage my time and work based on this principle: I write papers and do work when I am driven and motivated to, and in that context I am efficient and enjoy it. When I don\u2019t feel like doing something, I stop. Yeah, sometimes things are due and you HAVE to force yourself to do it, and you might not want to. The key in this case is that if you \u201cdon\u2019t feel like doing something\u201d\u009d consistently enough over time, you probably shouldn\u2019t be pursuing that thing, yo.\n\n**Knowing Myself:** So, after four+ years, on the journey from an old 17 to a young 22, I know myself pretty well. To be happy, I need moments of people, humor, moments alone, color, music, sweet and salty, and movement. I realize that I started this entry announcing a decision, and you\u2019ve probably read this far hungry to find out what that decision is exactly. It is a far far future goal, based on an activity that energizes me in the present moment, that has been a passion of mine since I was a kid, but I\u2019ve largely abandoned it since coming to college. It is very far from a desk job, puts me in a position of being self directed in my work, and being exposed constantly to creative output, color, music, and connecting with people. It fits well with my personality, emotional character, and motivational structure. It let\u2019s me wake up with the sun, and engage in a daily routine that I find fulfilling, that I wouldn\u2019t even consider work, but more just living. If you haven\u2019t guessed by now, and can\u2019t tell by now, I\u2019m not going to tell you. It\u2019s not technically a set profession,\u009d just a theme really. You can ask me in person. I can tell you that it offers no clear path, not very high salaries, but that I\u2019ve never felt so excited about something in my life, and I\u2019m going to work really hard at it, and be the best that I can be. I\u2019ve finally mustered the guts to follow my heart, and the feeling is full, beautiful, and like the euphoric high after a run. It\u2019s been scratching at my mental cat door for quite some time, gosh, took me long enough to remove the kitty blocker.\n\n![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>For the first time in many years, I&#8217;ve decided to do something based on wanting to do it, as opposed to doing what others want me to do.

This is a disease of Duke: this feeling that, given I went to this school, I have to either get a REALLY GOOD job, pursue some form of graduate study (preferably in something sciencey, if you want to go for something like English or History &#8211; FAIL!) or go out and save the world, in a social or teaching sense.<\/p>\n<p>We shuffle towards paths that are most accessible: I think that the majority of kids don&#8217;t really know what electrifies them, so it&#8217;s easy to latch on to options that are available, and seem do-able. A lot of graduate school (not all, mind you, but a lot) is probably pursued out of prolonging indecision, I think. It&#8217;s like, oh @#$%, I&#8217;m not really sure about what I want to do, but I can take these pre-reqs for med school, I can study for this test, and I know I can apply, hopefully get in somewhere, and then secure a future with financial and reputation-al prestige and security. I&#8217;m not saying that this is true for everyone &#8211; I&#8217;m sure that there are a group of kids out there that are electrified by the profession of medicine or law. I am just noticing a disproportionately large percentage of the student body that is enrolled along one of these courses, sometimes as a &#8220;last minute&#8221;\u009d decision, other times as a &#8220;well I declared it, and now I can&#8217;t take it back or people will think I suck,\u00c3\u00a2&#8221; or &#8220;heck, I&#8217;m not sure what else I&#8217;d do, this seems OK for now,&#8221;\u009d thing. Or maybe they really are convinced it&#8217;s their calling, and it might be. But once you jump on one of those wagons, Phew, your future is set, and it feels good now. If that&#8217;s the case, why aren&#8217;t people happier here? Time to make sacrifices now for that lofty future, because you might be happier then, right? On a tangent, we have this idea that given OK health, I am guaranteed a long life, and tomorrow is there. I&#8217;m of the mindset that the cancer patient is pretty much on par with you, me, no one is assured of longevity of life, the difference is having an idea about how much time you have left, and in that case, I could make an argument for wanting to be and not wanting to be the cancer patient. Anyway, back to the Duke undergrad. Okay, I&#8217;m pre- med! law! If not that, graduate school! research! If not that -must&#8230; get&#8230; job! beyond that, can I really call myself a Duke graduate? I have this perception that given a certain income, title, or life-path, that will make me happy. Errrm, probably not. I think happiness is more of a personality trait that changes in degree with regards to the situation that you choose, but that&#8217;s another bucket of ladybugs.<\/p>\n<p>In the domain of being true to yourself, Duke is a dangerous place. I would say that there is pressure, or even a disease, to be highly successful and achieving in the eyes of others. From the point of being accepted here to constantly being submerged in this murky pool of huge competition and academic arrogance, most of us develop (consciously or unconsciously) a feeling that, given I went to this school, I expect a certain salary, life outcome, certainty of success, once I am released. Also when you are here, if you didn&#8217;t already have it from high school, we further develop our fear of failure. I can&#8217;t tell you how many of my friends, who have the work ethic and drive to be successful, are terrified of not getting into graduate school, medical school, law school, or even getting a job or having some clear path after graduation. Heck, that&#8217;s been me this Fall. Hold up. First of all, there will always be opportunity for you given that you graduate college, let alone a brand name school like Duke. Wrong perspective. Too black and white.  If you are unemployed for a year or go out and try something completely crazy, that&#8217;s OK. Not being perfect at everything doesn&#8217;t switchback to failure, and neither does maintaining some path of career certainty. It is possible to do something and not be perfect or the best and be happy. The problem here is that we perceive &#8220;not-complete success&#8221; as failure. There is this feeling that if you aren&#8217;t making a solid 60-100K upon graduation or are on a path to make more than that, you&#8217;re a waste. And if you are electrified by something that doesn&#8217;t fit in that box? Better go on salary.com and find a way to make it fit. Sucks!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all so silly, we can smile about that: Guys, do you realize how silly all of this is? It might be me, but once I reached senior year, I started to look around and everyone looked really young. And the way that kids stress, work themselves to the core, and then drink like sailors is just silly. Given that I place a high emphasis on what others think of me, do I really care that much what an 18 year old thinks about my choices? Do I really need to be concerned with how attractive I come across to these gawky self-centered frat boys? Nope! When it comes down to it, every single person here is just that, a person, and in the same boat of being in some stage in the process of self discovery. We&#8217;re all sticking our toes in different puddles to test the temperature and are a little confused. This entire campus culture, pressure to succeed, make sacrifices, not be true to yourself, is just so ridiculous. I&#8217;m not sure what the administration is up to. No, adding flat screen TVs to unnecessary places doesn&#8217;t make people happier, or doing construction to make the campus even more impressive and uncomfortable, sorry!<\/p>\n<p>So in this mindset, I&#8217;ve relaxed a lot. I&#8217;m not so worried about what other people think that I&#8217;m doing, I sort of just do what moves me. It feels wonderful, and it feels free, but getting here was a huge suckfest. I am certain that I&#8217;ve been force to deal with things that most don&#8217;t even consider until later life. But in order to learn, and in order to grow, you have to survive adversity and make it through challenge. Nothing will ever be learned from a life of safety, privilege, acceptance, and easiness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Suckfest:<\/strong> Along this line of self discovery I had three large buckets of bad things poured on me. I had my heart elated and broken, I had three nasty surgeries that made me realize that life was no guarantee, and I had an identity stomp when I stopped running competitively. Let me summarize what I learned.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1)<\/strong> I learned that I have to pursue and put energy into the people, things, activities, and ideas that make me happy, regardless of others, because at the end of the day, the one person I have to report to is myself, and it&#8217;s always the case that when I feel anxiety or unhappy about something I haven&#8217;t stayed true to myself. What does this mean? It means really following your heart, and not just convincing yourself that you are. It means not changing your style of dress, behavior, or personality to be better liked. It means dropping people from your life that make you feel crappy, and surrounding yourself with people that make you feel good. In terms of my running, it had lost its previous passion because I was running for everyone but myself. As soon as I left the team I gradually re-found the fulfillment that was lost. It&#8217;s a little contradictory, but I now run more than I ever have, and I love it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2)<\/strong> I learned that communication and honesty are always the best policy. It&#8217;s a good and a bad thing to have a very thin filter between my mind and my lips, but I figure that anyone who is offended by my thought content and style probably isn&#8217;t a good friend match anyway. I also appreciate people who are open and honest with me, who I perceive to be more &#8220;real.&#8221;\u009d<\/p>\n<p><strong>3)<\/strong> I know that I score highly on this personality dimension called the &#8220;need to belong.&#8221;\u009d I am most fulfilled by connecting with people, by making them happy. If you want to make me really happy, make me a part of something you are doing, or come along with me in something I&#8217;m doing. If you want to hurt me, do something that alienates me, is dishonest, or manipulative. A few times of hurt, I can forgive and move on, but I know myself well, and there is a certain line of squirminess that people can cross when I feel the automatic necessity to make a social cut.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4)<\/strong> Having someone to love was like this forbidden fruit, that once I lost it, not only was the rejection painful, I wanted it back and felt incomplete without it. I realized through this process that life is most fulfilling when you are whole in yourself, and having something like a relationship isn&#8217;t even necessary. It sucks that society sends a prominent message that being single is akin to being incomplete, and that you should want a relationship. I can&#8217;t say either way whether I will stumble upon this love thing again, but I am certain that I don&#8217;t need it to be happy, and that when and if it comes along, I&#8217;ll just know it. And I am of the mindset that I will not change, or feel like I need to, for anyone. And given the pressure from society, the media, it&#8217;s pretty common to evaluate the people that are currently in your life and try to pick the best one, and even potentially obsess or force something that isn&#8217;t there. DON&#8217;T DO IT! I feel like I will either know, it will happen naturally, and if I&#8217;m unaware of a potential interest, if the guy in interested enough, he will put in the energy. I&#8217;m a strong believer that if the guy doesn&#8217;t have the energy or balls to pursue me, he&#8217;s probably not interested enough in the first place. Bottom line is that friends are amazing. I will always be socially healthy when I pursue and feed good friendships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5)<\/strong> Be good to yourself. You won&#8217;t always be in good spirits, and you don&#8217;t always have to smile. I find it refreshing to be pissed now and then &gt;:P It&#8217;s OK to value or fall into your neutral and negative moments as it is your positive. It is in the days of high negative emotion that you need to be better to yourself. I even sometimes go as far as to view myself as another person, and make decisions about how to treat myself based on that. I felt crappy the other morning, so I went to the state park. I&#8217;m also a firm believer in doing what you want when you feel like it. I manage my time and work based on this principle: I write papers and do work when I am driven and motivated to, and in that context I am efficient and enjoy it. When I don&#8217;t feel like doing something, I stop. Yeah, sometimes things are due and you HAVE to force yourself to do it, and you might not want to. The key in this case is that if you &#8220;don&#8217;t feel like doing something&#8221;\u009d consistently enough over time, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be pursuing that thing, yo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Knowing Myself:<\/strong> So, after four+ years, on the journey from an old 17 to a young 22, I know myself pretty well. To be happy, I need moments of people, humor, moments alone, color, music, sweet and salty, and movement. I realize that I started this entry announcing a decision, and you&#8217;ve probably read this far hungry to find out what that decision is exactly. It is a far far future goal, based on an activity that energizes me in the present moment, that has been a passion of mine since I was a kid, but I&#8217;ve largely abandoned it since coming to college. It is very far from a desk job, puts me in a position of being self directed in my work, and being exposed constantly to creative output, color, music, and connecting with people. It fits well with my personality, emotional character, and motivational structure. It let&#8217;s me wake up with the sun, and engage in a daily routine that I find fulfilling, that I wouldn&#8217;t even consider work, but more just living. If you haven&#8217;t guessed by now, and can&#8217;t tell by now, I&#8217;m not going to tell you. It&#8217;s not technically a set profession,\u009d just a theme really. You can ask me in person. I can tell you that it offers no clear path, not very high salaries, but that I&#8217;ve never felt so excited about something in my life, and I&#8217;m going to work really hard at it, and be the best that I can be. I&#8217;ve finally mustered the guts to follow my heart, and the feeling is full, beautiful, and like the euphoric high after a run. It&#8217;s been scratching at my mental cat door for quite some time, gosh, took me long enough to remove the kitty blocker.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" \/><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sat, 22 Nov 2008 14:08:27 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 21:11:32 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 22 Nov 2008 14:08:27 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":46,"title":"My Brother is Amazing!","slug":"my-brother-is-amazing","markdown":"\n[Here\u2019s why.]( http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/journal\/121541668\/abstract)\n\n**Schools that Brother is admitted to:**  \n Brown University  \n Tufts University (call from the Dean with a scholarship)  \n Case Western University  \n Ohio State (with a scholarship too woot)\n\n**Interviews at**  \n UPenn  \n Dartmouth  \n Harvard  \n schools in NYC DON\u2019T GO THERE!\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\" http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/journal\/121541668\/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Here&#8217;s why.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Schools that Brother is admitted to:<\/strong><br \/>\nBrown University<br \/>\nTufts University (call from the Dean with a scholarship)<br \/>\nCase Western University<br \/>\nOhio State (with a scholarship too woot)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interviews at<\/strong><br \/>\nUPenn<br \/>\nDartmouth<br \/>\nHarvard<br \/>\nschools in NYC DON&#8217;T GO THERE!<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sat, 29 Nov 2008 09:36:40 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 04 Jan 2014 04:47:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 29 Nov 2008 09:36:40 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":42,"title":"You're hot then you're cold - that means you're human?","slug":"youre-hot-then-youre-cold-that-means-youre-human","markdown":"\nIt\u2019s really wonderful to feel like part of a group. it goes along with this fundamental human \u201cneed to belong\u201d\u009d that one of my psychology Professors, Mark Leary, has been studying for quite some time. However, there seems to be a conflicting dynamic that works with this need to belong that I believe leads to what we observe as a hook up culture. On the one hand, it feels good to feel like part of a group, but on the other hand, it feels terrible to be rejected. There seems to be a difference between inclusion and exclusion. To be included means to be invited to things, share inside jokes, and have a common understanding that you fit well within some social fabric. To be excluded, on the other hand, can be overt or subtle. An overt exclusion is someone going out of their way to send you a strong message that you are different, or don\u2019t belong with the group, or are closer to belonging to an outgroup.\u009d A subtle exclusion might be as simple as someone or a group of people that you thought you were close with doing something together and not telling you about it, even if it was spur of the moment and inviting you wouldn\u2019t have been natural. In this case, the exclusion is really more of a perception on your side of the cranium. Regardless of the incentive or reason for exclusion, it makes us feel badly either way. So we generally govern our lives possibly not to take part in every social situation that crosses our paths, but to minimize the chances of being excluded. So I may not want to participate, but I sure as heck want the invite!\n\nWhat does that mean, on a day to day basis, for how we interact with people? It leads to larger friend groups with more people and weaker connections. It means that when the desire to connect with people comes about, we send a mass group email of the flavor \u201cdoes anyone want to do X\u009d?\u201d as opposed to a personal message to one other person. It means that even if we desire more emotional intimacy with a friend, it\u2019s incredibly hard to pursue because there is the risk of scaring them off with a need, and in the process being more separated from the larger group you are both affiliated with. Thus, it is safer to seek social fulfillment in a larger, more impersonal context than reveal more and take chances on few people. It also means that when those times come around when we do need to talk to that one person, we find ourselves surrounded with many, acquainted with wonderful people, but not quite close enough to be able to call anyone, and ask to stop by for a hug.\n\nI find this on my mind because it\u2019s very apparent to me how many kids here at school work so hard to play it cool. The boy on the bus sits in a certain way, is dressed in a certain way, takes off his glasses in a certain way, to send the message that he is suave, collected, and untouchable. The worker outers at the gym that approach the pullup bar aren\u2019t so much into the pullups but making them a performance of brute strength and muscle to envy. Many of my customers seem to be worried that their choice of lunch for the day sends a particular message about them to me, to their friends, or even the people around them. Even with eye contact, passing someone by, people work so hard to be it all that a huge component of realness is just gone. People speak in cliche\u2019s, use the same expressions and gestures, and hide serious thoughts and emotions behind a facade of their choice, for whatever is appropriate for the situation. Because acting any differently, or maybe doing what you really want to do or something that feels more true to yourself, may not be looked upon favorably by someone. Yes, you might be excluded, so to compensate you do what you perceive as necessary to be most socially accepted. This is where superficiality, or fakeness, grows from.\n\nAnd I find it tiring. How I love to put energy into others because it makes me feel close to them, and it feels good, but how tiring it is to be just another person included in a mass email. How I wish to get closer to some of my friends, but that\u2019s not possible in a large group of people afraid to bring down their facade. But on the other thing, it\u2019s a nice thing to have superficiality, because there are people that I have no desire to get close to, or know more about, and the established social structure and superficiality allows me to deal with them and move on with my day. It\u2019s just a fact that you can only maintain so many friendships at one time, and it makes sense to maintain the most valuable ones.\n\nIt\u2019s probably a good thing that I\u2019m graduating, because I\u2019ve reached a point when the same large group dynamic is getting old. I\u2019m not sure if this is a sign of gaining more maturity or possibly just getting tired of the daily performance of life, but I crave, selfishly, to feel connected to one or two people, that I might trust wholeheartedly and revel in understanding each others strengths, weaknesses, imperfections, and all those things that make human beings interesting and real. News flash, emotions and imperfections doesn\u2019t equate to being weak or a bad friend and does not mean that you will be rejected. Sometimes these things can turn people away, but then I\u2019d argue if the person is uncomfortable with your degree of desire for emotional connectedness, it wasn\u2019t a friendship match in the first place.\n\nI think, for my generation at least, that the current culture works, at least in the life of a busy college student. I do strongly believe, however, that a time will come when many realize that this dynamic isn\u2019t enough for the human heart. That even the most achievement oriented and busy\/important\/go-getters have moments when meeting a deadline or going to a group dinner could never feed the same hunger that sitting down and talking with one person might. I can speak for myself: I\u2019m incredibly highly traited in the \u201cgo-getter\u201d\u009d dimension, and sometimes doing that go-getter thing is missing a component of shared investment.\n\nMy mind is on this tread of thinking because, for myself, I know that I am terrified of relying on others, and of relinquishing my self sufficiency. I think that my best efforts to maintain a feeling of connectedness with my friends is to do little nice things for them, possibly in fear of losing my social ties I feel good to do these things because it is an assurance of maintaining connection. With this dynamic I can maintain my belongingness without ever sacrificing self sufficiency. But I do realize that, for when a large stressor does hit me unexpectedly, I have not allowed myself to get close enough to anyone to feel OK about calling them for that hug. It\u2019s primarily the Type-A orientedness of my personality that I attribute to this need for self sufficiency, because I feel huge accomplishment and pride in forever doing things early and efficiently. This is what has driven my desire and now natural tendency to wake up early, finish things hugely in advance, and always have backup plans for everything. I believe that as long as life stays away from large tumbles that I\u2019ve had in the past, I have enough insight into myself to maintain smooth sailing. I can\u2019t imagine that I can be hit harder than I already have, so my skin is thick, but I better knock on wood for that one. Be right back.\n\nI can forsee, and know from experience, that life is not predictable, and I know that there will be times when I have questions and can\u2019t think up an answer, or maybe just need some reassurance and a hug, when my self sufficiency just won\u2019t replace someone that cares about me. I\u2019d say that the observation of giving and receiving affection in what I perceive to be my culture has been one of my biggest conflicts in that I desire that same dynamic but feel iffy about applying it to my own life. But with these desires in mind and knowledge about myself and the people I enjoy spending time with, this might help me find those few that I will be able to just show up, and jump on for a hug. Yes, that will be a wonderful connection.

Be right back.<\/p>\n<p>I can forsee, and know from experience, that life is not predictable, and I know that there will be times when I have questions and can&#8217;t think up an answer, or maybe just need some reassurance and a hug, when my self sufficiency just won&#8217;t replace someone that cares about me. I&#8217;d say that the observation of giving and receiving affection in what I perceive to be my culture has been one of my biggest conflicts in that I desire that same dynamic but feel iffy about applying it to my own life. But with these desires in mind and knowledge about myself and the people I enjoy spending time with, this might help me find those few that I will be able to just show up, and jump on for a hug. Yes, that will be a wonderful connection.

DO YOU GET SCARED IN THE DARK?<br \/>\nI prefer falling asleep in complete darkness.

THE LAST PERSON TO MAKE YOU CRY?<br \/>\nWell, my friend made me cry, because I was laughing so hard <img src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>13.

FAVORITE QUOTE?<br \/>\nSomething I posted recently&#8230; You are either good, trying to get good, or you&#8217;ve given up. I guess it&#8217;s not really a quote, more an idea.<\/p>\n<p>33.

HAVE YOU EVER HAD SURGERY?<br \/>\nOh hell yes, I&#8217;m a pro.<\/p>\n<p>42. WHAT DO YOU GET COMPLIMENTED ABOUT MOST?<br \/>\nProbably the isha necklace that I always wear<\/p>\n<p>43.

WHAT IS THE BIGGEST TURN OFF OF THE OPPOSITE SEX?<br \/>\nwhatever qualities define a jocky &#8220;i&#8217;m so cool&#8221; guy &#8211; your stereotypical frat boy or lacrosse player.<\/p>\n<p>48.

WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE LUNCH MEAT?<br \/>\nProbably turkey&#8230; although I&#8217;m generally not an avid consumer of lunch meat. It&#8217;s slimy.<\/p>\n<p>52. ANY BAD HABITS?<br \/>\nYeah, I always give myself hang nails. And it seems to be in an effort to get rid of them. Silly girl.<\/p>\n<p>53. ARE YOU A JEALOUS PERSON?<br \/>\nI think if I were in a relationship and there were other girls hanging around, I could be jealous, but it wouldn&#8217;t last long because I would act on it.

That is the nature of life. In that mindset, I\u2019d like to say some final things. I \u2018m a lot more articulate with key than with word, making this note my expression of choice. Here goes.\n\nMy time here has ended wonderfully, been challenging at times, and I am most grateful for the things that I have learned about myself, and the questions that this environment elicited in me that might still need answers. I came here as a sophomore knowing absolutely no one, a large feat given the size and plastic-wrapped nature of this institution. I\u2019ve many a times said that, in retrospect, I would not have transferred, and from an academic standpoint and examination of the large social structure, perhaps this is true. But when I zoom in to the people that I have come to care about here, I am certain that coming here has only broadened and enlivened my life.\n\nI am grateful for the people that have made my experience very rich, the professors that have challenged me, and the few that were there for me during some of the harder times. My early to bed \u2013 early to rise and tendency to be introverted make me a more challenging friend to keep, and I am so grateful to you guys that consistently poked me to keep the connection strong.\n\nTo all of my friends: When I think back to my time at Duke, I\u2019m going to remember Sitar Sundays, Crowell being the best and baddest dorm with a pimp RA crew, the many times I wrinkled my nose or teared from laughing so hard, baking like a wild woman at Smart Home, and all seemingly insignificant number of times that we ate out and bonded over chicken, awkward waiters, and discussion about\u2026 oh you know \ud83d\ude1b\n\nMemories are of a nature that they don\u2019t store in complete sentences or images, so that is how I will share them, in a mental burp, one thing leading to the next. I\u2019ll probably add to this as I think of good memories, but here is a start.\n\n1) TWINS!!! First gergz and BG, and now Ravi and Jayson backpack twins.  \n 2) The Grants\u2026 potench. potench.  \n 3) Ravi\u2019s sweet-ass car\u2026 (or might I say, sweet ass-car, hehe), many walks to and from the Blue Zone, somehow getting 4 people across the backseat and to the destination like cozy sardines.  \n 4) Gergz magoo and his love of shredded wheat. 2nd dinner, 3rd dinner, you know.. shooshoopeedoo!  \n 5) Bryan and Gergz monopolizing the name game with characters from Bleach\u2026 yeaaah!  \n 6) How everyone always got rotisserie chicken with two sides, and Greg scammed them to get an extra one, and I never could do it.  \n 7) Rhut\u2019s awesomely dry and direct sense of humor, and thanks for giving me proper instructions about crossing my legs when I\u2019m wearing a dress, hehe.  \n 8) Bryan flexing at the most unexpected, and completely funny times with appropriate facial expressions  \n 9) Andy, Lo Lo!  \n 10) Class with Ken, BG, and Z Spring of sophomore year, making little cute Flash videos and finding excuses to watch random stuff on YouTube in class. Nice!  \n 11) FAAIL! WIN!  \n 12) CanIhaveitCanIhaveit?  \n 13) My one crazy dance night at Parizade \u2013 I might never be able to stay up that late again, but man, that was fun.  \n 14) Phil doing the night elf dance on top of the arts warehouse, ftw!  \n 15) Niiiiiice!  \n 16) Sash, Phil, and Raffi, we had some amazing times in ISIS, like, everyday was awesome! Ghost ride tha whip, yo!  \n 17) Z \u2013 Sapachi! I\u2019ll just say it\u2026 we were badass! And it was really fun. I\u2019m really excited for you about that company you will be working for\u2026 their logo is incredibly cute, and on that observation alone I think it\u2019s going to be a hit!  \n 18) Link! Ravi, the few times that I went to the link to join you studying. It was a push for me, because libraries are frightening, but I got to see your determination and work ethic. I\u2019m never going to forget Plowbear, or how easily you laughed and made everyone feel good. I really look up to you for your ability to find balance.  \n 19) Congyi, creme brulee. and FIRE!  \n 20) Mark, Rui, and Mia\u2026 and the amazing 3 day video project-that-probably-needed-3-months, and we still rocked it.  \n 21) Thanksgiving at Smart Home, best of my life! PIE DAY! and Salssaaaa!  \n 22) Disney movies, Scrubs, and thai food with Preeyanka and Jo, and cooking to music and not being afraid to belt it out!  \n 23) Ying-ying always finding time to join the crew, and I will be forever grateful for letting me borrow those dresses!  \n 24) Threadless T-shirts, Fail blog, TED talks, and thisiswhyyourfat blog rock my world.  \n 25) Life conversations with Percy while I pedaled and talked away, making him yet again late for swim class.  \n 26) Duck sauce from Panda Express, ty Jason for bringing me it special! And thank you for always giving me a call to grab dinner, and pushing me to leave my little introverted shell to have some amazing experience I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise had! You\u2019ve been a great friend, you\u2019re a great listener, and you\u2019re going to be an exceptional doctor! ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)  \n 27) My birthday celebration at the Loop, surrounded by good friends  \n 28) The infamous walk back from central the night of parizade, coming up with clever phrases for the YouTube video\u2026 \u201cmy $#%@, variet-ee bucket\u2026 your @#%#, chick-en nugget!\u201d  \n 29) Bryan\u2019s big stomach, and that turd waiter that stole my dinner. Z, thanks for standing up for me!  \n 30) Gingerbread house making event. Megan, your house was lovely. Jason made a tower that looked like it came from a five year old, and Mark and Tim went for the train that looked like a phallic symbol, hehe  \n 31) How no matter where we go, Torero\u2019s always wins.  \n 32) Dayo I\u2019m-a-big-boy!!! getting surprised to run into you at Brugger\u2019s and having good conversation that always brightened my day before class!  \n 33) Ravi\u2019s super room fan, ftw!  \n 34) Andy\u2019s sweet apartment for hosting dinners\u2026 with lasagna and pancakes. I\u2019ve never seen such a large bag of pancake mix.  \n 35) The passing of the RA room from Sarah to Jason, and how my first room in Crowell when they moved me there Spring of sophomore year used to be the empty hankypanky room. haha.  \n 36) Mario Kart and Ping Pong at Rhut, BG, Matt, and Z\u2019s house.  \n 37) Cereal with Kiril, always fantastic. Kiril, you put so much energy into us, and deserved so much more than a cake! You are the BEST GR on campus, hands down!  \n 38) The wine tasting\u2026 hehe.  \n 39) Jason telling Ravi he has beautiful eyes, and Ravi saying \u201cshh not here!\u201d  \n 40) The back of yo\u2019 head is ridikulus  \n 41) Trevor and Menelik\u2019s hot wing challenge at Chai\u2019s.

That is the nature of life. In that mindset, I&#8217;d like to say some final things. I &#8216;m a lot more articulate with key than with word, making this note my expression of choice. Here goes.<\/p>\n<p>My time here has ended wonderfully, been challenging at times, and I am most grateful for the things that I have learned about myself, and the questions that this environment elicited in me that might still need answers. I came here as a sophomore knowing absolutely no one, a large feat given the size and plastic-wrapped nature of this institution. I&#8217;ve many a times said that, in retrospect, I would not have transferred, and from an academic standpoint and examination of the large social structure, perhaps this is true. But when I zoom in to the people that I have come to care about here, I am certain that coming here has only broadened and enlivened my life.<\/p>\n<p>I am grateful for the people that have made my experience very rich, the professors that have challenged me, and the few that were there for me during some of the harder times. My early to bed &#8211; early to rise and tendency to be introverted make me a more challenging friend to keep, and I am so grateful to you guys that consistently poked me to keep the connection strong.<\/p>\n<p>To all of my friends: When I think back to my time at Duke, I&#8217;m going to remember Sitar Sundays, Crowell being the best and baddest dorm with a pimp RA crew, the many times I wrinkled my nose or teared from laughing so hard, baking like a wild woman at Smart Home, and all seemingly insignificant number of times that we ate out and bonded over chicken, awkward waiters, and discussion about&#8230; oh you know \ud83d\ude1b<\/p>\n<p>Memories are of a nature that they don&#8217;t store in complete sentences or images, so that is how I will share them, in a mental burp, one thing leading to the next. I&#8217;ll probably add to this as I think of good memories, but here is a start.<\/p>\n<p>1) TWINS!!! First gergz and BG, and now Ravi and Jayson backpack twins.<br \/>\n2) The Grants&#8230; potench. potench.<br \/>\n3) Ravi&#8217;s sweet-ass car&#8230; (or might I say, sweet ass-car, hehe), many walks to and from the Blue Zone, somehow getting 4 people across the backseat and to the destination like cozy sardines.<br \/>\n4) Gergz magoo and his love of shredded wheat. 2nd dinner, 3rd dinner, you know.. shooshoopeedoo!<br \/>\n5) Bryan and Gergz monopolizing the name game with characters from Bleach&#8230; yeaaah!<br \/>\n6) How everyone always got rotisserie chicken with two sides, and Greg scammed them to get an extra one, and I never could do it.<br \/>\n7) Rhut&#8217;s awesomely dry and direct sense of humor, and thanks for giving me proper instructions about crossing my legs when I&#8217;m wearing a dress, hehe.<br \/>\n8) Bryan flexing at the most unexpected, and completely funny times with appropriate facial expressions<br \/>\n9) Andy, Lo Lo!<br \/>\n10) Class with Ken, BG, and Z Spring of sophomore year, making little cute Flash videos and finding excuses to watch random stuff on YouTube in class. Nice!<br \/>\n11) FAAIL! WIN!<br \/>\n12) CanIhaveitCanIhaveit?<br \/>\n13) My one crazy dance night at Parizade &#8211; I might never be able to stay up that late again, but man, that was fun.<br \/>\n14) Phil doing the night elf dance on top of the arts warehouse, ftw!<br \/>\n15) Niiiiiice!<br \/>\n16) Sash, Phil, and Raffi, we had some amazing times in ISIS, like, everyday was awesome! Ghost ride tha whip, yo!<br \/>\n17) Z &#8211; Sapachi! I&#8217;ll just say it&#8230; we were badass! And it was really fun. I&#8217;m really excited for you about that company you will be working for&#8230; their logo is incredibly cute, and on that observation alone I think it&#8217;s going to be a hit!<br \/>\n18) Link! Ravi, the few times that I went to the link to join you studying. It was a push for me, because libraries are frightening, but I got to see your determination and work ethic. I&#8217;m never going to forget Plowbear, or how easily you laughed and made everyone feel good. I really look up to you for your ability to find balance.<br \/>\n19) Congyi, creme brulee. and FIRE!<br \/>\n20) Mark, Rui, and Mia&#8230; and the amazing 3 day video project-that-probably-needed-3-months, and we still rocked it.<br \/>\n21) Thanksgiving at Smart Home, best of my life! PIE DAY! and Salssaaaa!<br \/>\n22) Disney movies, Scrubs, and thai food with Preeyanka and Jo, and cooking to music and not being afraid to belt it out!<br \/>\n23) Ying-ying always finding time to join the crew, and I will be forever grateful for letting me borrow those dresses!<br \/>\n24) Threadless T-shirts, Fail blog, TED talks, and thisiswhyyourfat blog rock my world.<br \/>\n25) Life conversations with Percy while I pedaled and talked away, making him yet again late for swim class.<br \/>\n26) Duck sauce from Panda Express, ty Jason for bringing me it special! And thank you for always giving me a call to grab dinner, and pushing me to leave my little introverted shell to have some amazing experience I wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise had! You&#8217;ve been a great friend, you&#8217;re a great listener, and you&#8217;re going to be an exceptional doctor! <img src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" \/><br \/>\n27) My birthday celebration at the Loop, surrounded by good friends<br \/>\n28) The infamous walk back from central the night of parizade, coming up with clever phrases for the YouTube video&#8230; &#8220;my $#%@, variet-ee bucket&#8230; your @#%#, chick-en nugget!&#8221;<br \/>\n29) Bryan&#8217;s big stomach, and that turd waiter that stole my dinner. Z, thanks for standing up for me!<br \/>\n30) Gingerbread house making event. Megan, your house was lovely. Jason made a tower that looked like it came from a five year old, and Mark and Tim went for the train that looked like a phallic symbol, hehe<br \/>\n31) How no matter where we go, Torero&#8217;s always wins.<br \/>\n32) Dayo I&#8217;m-a-big-boy!!! getting surprised to run into you at Brugger&#8217;s and having good conversation that always brightened my day before class!<br \/>\n33) Ravi&#8217;s super room fan, ftw!<br \/>\n34) Andy&#8217;s sweet apartment for hosting dinners&#8230; with lasagna and pancakes. I&#8217;ve never seen such a large bag of pancake mix.<br \/>\n35) The passing of the RA room from Sarah to Jason, and how my first room in Crowell when they moved me there Spring of sophomore year used to be the empty hankypanky room. haha.<br \/>\n36) Mario Kart and Ping Pong at Rhut, BG, Matt, and Z&#8217;s house.<br \/>\n37) Cereal with Kiril, always fantastic. Kiril, you put so much energy into us, and deserved so much more than a cake! You are the BEST GR on campus, hands down!<br \/>\n38) The wine tasting&#8230; hehe.<br \/>\n39) Jason telling Ravi he has beautiful eyes, and Ravi saying &#8220;shh not here!&#8221;<br \/>\n40) The back of yo&#8217; head is ridikulus<br \/>\n41) Trevor and Menelik&#8217;s hot wing challenge at Chai&#8217;s. That&#8230; was&#8230; sticky!<br \/>\n42) Dinner and pool with Matt&#8217;s family&#8230; Matt, I love your family!

Working, running, and maintaining a solid routine makes me very happy. Research is indeed the best avenue for the more intellectual, quiet, and thoughtful of our species to feel like a part of something fantastic, to feel the satisfaction of helping the world in a big way, and to feed the eternal intellectual hunger that lives in the mind.\n\n**Things:** The Spongebob watch for $10.99 at Kroger, I\u2019ve been seeing it for quite some time now, and I want it more than anything.

Case in point? My trip to the storage place.\n\nThe woman that helped me was pretty nice, and her slowness didn\u2019t bother me so much. I enjoyed the time standing at the counter and admiring the details of the characters on my lanyard, and looked for similarities between the shapes of my keys. I went to move my small load of things into my 5 X 10 sweetspot, and came back to find the couple that was waiting behind me arguing over a charge of 20 bucks. I was aware of the online discount, but didn\u2019t think that it was worth troubling a perfectly good customer\/salesperson relationship by complaining, having to re-do the transaction, can we think about it like opportunity cost of time? Opportunity cost of relationships? Opportunity cost of an ulcer? At what dollar amount do I care to say something?\n\nI think the difference is that I looked at her as another human being and not someone that was there to give me what I wanted. I felt grateful for her giving me the opportunity to slow down for a few moments, and observe something that I hadn\u2019t given attention before. I was grateful for her kindness. I could have easily looked at the entire situation from another viewpoint \u2013 a negative one \u2013 how slow she was! And she forgot my discount! The couple wound up storming out to go to another storage place, arguing with each other, and I said \u201cI hope your day looks up, it\u2019s pretty nice outside, bye!\u201d\u009d and returned to my car. I wonder how the rest of the couple\u2019s day went? Did they find a storage spot, and if so, was it worth it? Money wise? Mood wise? Time wise? Did they potentially just close the door for returning to that place? Is playing the role of the angry customer even worth it?\n\nThe question I really want to ask has to do with manipulation and using leverage and other manipulative strategies, maybe some passive agressive-ness, to get what you want. In a nutshell, it\u2019s using people. I know a handful of people that get by with this strategy, and I find that when they ask me for something, the normal rewarding feeling that I get when helping someone that I care about just isn\u2019t there. In a few of the cases, I can tell a relationship isn\u2019t balanced, and my kindness is being taken advantage of, just by that feeling.\n\nIs this idea of networking any different? No matter what you call it, I can\u2019t stand it. At the end of the day, the item may be obtained, the money may be saved, you may get what you desire at the use or abuse or guilt of someone else, but it\u2019s such a dirty game, and I can\u2019t imagine the manipulator will have many friends in the long run.\n\nIn this case, we were in the same situation, but we acted upon it differently and as a result, wound up with two completely different outcomes and states of mind. Interesting.\n\n\n","html":"<p>It&#8217;s so easy to get caught up in little things, and when you only consider monetary costs, it seems that overall costs can still exceed benefits, even if you save money.

The couple wound up storming out to go to another storage place, arguing with each other, and I said &#8220;I hope your day looks up, it&#8217;s pretty nice outside, bye!&#8221;\u009d and returned to my car. I wonder how the rest of the couple&#8217;s day went? Did they find a storage spot, and if so, was it worth it? Money wise? Mood wise? Time wise? Did they potentially just close the door for returning to that place? Is playing the role of the angry customer even worth it?<\/p>\n<p>The question I really want to ask has to do with manipulation and using leverage and other manipulative strategies, maybe some passive agressive-ness, to get what you want. In a nutshell, it&#8217;s using people. I know a handful of people that get by with this strategy, and I find that when they ask me for something, the normal rewarding feeling that I get when helping someone that I care about just isn&#8217;t there. In a few of the cases, I can tell a relationship isn&#8217;t balanced, and my kindness is being taken advantage of, just by that feeling.<\/p>\n<p>Is this idea of networking any different? No matter what you call it, I can&#8217;t stand it. At the end of the day, the item may be obtained, the money may be saved, you may get what you desire at the use or abuse or guilt of someone else, but it&#8217;s such a dirty game, and I can&#8217;t imagine the manipulator will have many friends in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, we were in the same situation, but we acted upon it differently and as a result, wound up with two completely different outcomes and states of mind.

It was one of those intensely white lights that is tiny but could light up an entire road. I took it for one of my 4:00am runs, just for fun.

I really just wanted to see what he had to say about the chipset that we installed. He didn\u2019t say much, but he did forget about 3 essential drivers that I had to go back and find.

Let me set the scene. We printed out a list of coordinates, and started out adventure on main West. It\u2019s a blistering 90+ degrees, I made the mistake of wearing open shoes and a black shirt, and our navigation device (my non-phone i-phone) is having a little trouble working as a GPS. There was a moment of hesitation when we weren\u2019t sure if we could go geocaching at all, but thanks to download a quick, free app, we had something that would work.\n\nSo we proceeded to use my 3G Network lacking i-phone to input coordinates and attempt to locate the caches. The GPS doesn\u2019t require an internet connection, however producing the original map did, so we would squeeze next to a building on campus, grab the wireless signal, input the coordinates and produce the map, and then start our search.\n\nOur first attempt was with a cache that was supposedly near the Perkins and Bostock libraries. After ten minutes of digging around in brambles and bushes, we decided to move on. There were just too many muggles around and we looked suspicious! Oh, and the use of the word \u201cmuggles\u201d is very much part of the geocaching online culture. You don\u2019t want to be caught snooping around by these\u2026 non-geocaching-muggle-folk, haha.\n\nAttempt number two was somewhere around the Camel statue near the old Biology Building. The flashing dot led us towards the woods, away from the statue, and it was immediately apparent that the coordinates were directly on a very steep hill. Not only was it overgrown and impossible to get to, it occurred to us that the likelihood of this cache falling down the slope during a rainstorm was very high. After a good search, we gave up on this one as well, and decided to head over to the Nasher.\n\nWe were originally worried that the title \u201cNash \u2018Er Teeth\u201d would imply that this geocache would be a hard find, but it wasn\u2019t at all! It must have been in the 90s, so we started our excursion by heading into the wonderfully chilly Nasher museum. Anyone that stops by here to look for this cache should definitely bring an ID to gain access to the galleries at the Nasher, or minimally stop at the cafe inside for a cool drink.\n\nOnce we were ready, we headed out the back door, past a triangular slab of stone, and down the path. We found a small cluster of woods within 100 feet of the museum, and then saw the aforementioned poison ivy, and then BOOM there it was! We had a few unsuccessful searches earlier in the day, and this was our first successful find as Team PumkinNappers, and what a great one it was!\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matt-00003-300x225.jpg \"Matt finds the cache!\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matt-00003.jpg)\n\nThe hiding spot was very cleverly constructed, and the log book incredibly cute. We traded a sheet of stickers with a very cool toy constructed out of an Altoids box (you\u2019ll just have to find the cache to push it\u2019s button and see what it does!) and carefully returned it to its home.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matt-00004-300x225.jpg \"The Snoopy Log Book\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matt-00004.jpg)\n\nWhat a great first find! We then proceeded to head down Campus Drive and investigate a cache near the arts warehouse. We got slightly distracted by the cool new \u201cDuke\u201d sign on the building.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matt-00005-300x225.jpg \"Duke, in the palm of your hand!\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matt-00005.jpg) [![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matt-00006-300x225.jpg \"...or just generally on top of your head\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matt-00006.jpg)\n\nIt sort of reminds me of the factory from Charlie and The Chocolate Factory!\n\nSo this Geocaching thing is excellent!

I wanted to create one anyway. Here are the basic tools that you will need:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/punkin-00002-300x225.jpg \"Step 1: Materials\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/punkin-00002.jpg)\n\n- A ripe mango (it should smell sweet)\n- A cutting board\n- A sharp knife (I prefer serrated)\n\n1) The first step is to figure out the orientation of the seed. Mangos have giant, oblong seeds that span from the top to the bottom of the fruit. You are going to want to cut around the skinny side of the seed. It\u2019s easy to find \u2013 orient the fruit so the thinner side is face up.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/punkin-00003-300x225.jpg \"Step 2: Orientation\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/punkin-00003.jpg)\n\n2. To make the first cut, you want to slice downward, slightly off center to the right to make room for the seed.

I wanted to create one anyway.  Here are the basic tools that you will need:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/punkin-00002.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-300\" title=\"Step 1: Materials\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/punkin-00002-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A ripe mango (it should smell sweet)<\/li>\n<li>A cutting board<\/li>\n<li>A sharp knife (I prefer serrated)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1) The first step is to figure out the orientation of the seed.  Mangos have giant, oblong seeds that span from the top to the bottom of the fruit.  You are going to want to cut around the skinny side of the seed.  It&#8217;s easy to find &#8211; orient the fruit so the thinner side is face up.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/punkin-00003.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-301\" title=\"Step 2: Orientation\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/punkin-00003-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>2.

Clay - Tux!","slug":"the-merging-of-penguin-and-clay-tux","markdown":"\nMy excitement about fixing up an old Thinkpad T30 and installing a Linux OS has inspired me to create Tux the penguin out of clay.\n\n1. First, I mixed a black with a gray with a slight shimmer, and worked the mixture until it was uniform in appearance.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00012x-225x300.jpg \"1. Create body form\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00012x.jpg)\n\n2. Then, I molded the clay into a pear shape. Save a small chunk to make his flippers.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00013x-300x225.jpg \"2. Create white bib\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00013x.jpg)\n\n3. To make the bib, I rolled out a small ball of shimmery white, and made it slightly oblong with one end thicker than the other. Then I squished it flat on the table, and shaped it as you see above.\n\n4. The bib can be gently pressed into the white. I definitely made this piece too thick \u2013 it would have looked much better a bit thinner.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00014x-300x225.jpg \"3. Bib placement\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00014x.jpg)\n\n5. I toned down the yellow clay by mixing it with white, and then prepared a beak bottom and top by making two small triangles. I actually only needed one of the triangles, and I used my fingernail to mark the \u201clips.\u201d\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00015x-300x225.jpg \"4. Prepare beak\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00015x.jpg)\n\n6. Place the lips directly at the top of the white bib.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00016x-300x225.jpg \"5. Beak Placement\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00016x.jpg)\n\n7. Eyes are fairly easy \u2013 two small white circles, and then two slightly smaller black circles for the pupils. You can use the eyes to convey expression. For mine, since this guy is a graphic, I went with a generic stare.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00018x-300x225.jpg \"6. Eyes\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00018x.jpg)\n\n8. Separate the remaining black clay into two pieces, and roll each piece into a 3\/4 inch log. Flatten one end slightly more than the other to get the \u201cflipper shape\u201d below. To attach them, I like to make X\u2019s on the back of the surface being attached, and the surface I am attaching to. I then take a rounded tool and work the edges together, as you can see below. After merging, you can use your finger or a smooth tool to get rid of the rough edges.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00019x-300x225.jpg \"7. Flippers\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00019x.jpg)\n\n9. Tux after getting his flippers! In retrospect I would have made the flippers thinner at the top as well. It\u2019s a delicate balance of making the piece substantial enough to not crack immediately when\/after it\u2019s baked, and making things tiny\/delicate\/thin\/beautiful!\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00020x-300x225.jpg \"8. Final flipper placement\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00020x.jpg)\n\n10. To make the feet, I mixed some more yellow and white, and formed two small balls to attach to his bottom for \u201clegs\u201d (as you can see on the left). I then made two slightly larger balls and formed them into thin isosceles triangles. I put the triangles together, side by side, with the smallest angles touching at the bottom. This is the corner that will be integrated with the leg stubs. On the top, I pinched together the inner edges to make a center toe, and used a pencil to indent the center of each top, creating the impression of two outside toes.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00021x-300x225.jpg \"9. Feet\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00021x.jpg)\n\n11. The last step was to gently work the feed into the body and legs, as was done with the flippers.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00022x-300x225.jpg \"10. Complete Tux\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00022x.jpg)\n\n12. The general rule for clay is to bake it on a clean sheet at 250 degrees, 15 minutes for every 1\/4\u2033 thickness.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00024x-300x225.jpg \"11. Oven settings\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00024x.jpg)\n\n13. Tux was in there about 45 minutes.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00025x-300x225.jpg \"12. Baked penguin...\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00025x.jpg)\n\n14. Finished! I gave him a quick glaze to bring out the shimmer in the body.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00026-300x225.jpg \"Fini!\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00026.jpg)\n\nAnd here comes my perfectionist nature \u2013 he\u2019s cute, but all I see is what is wrong with him! These are the things that I would do differently if I gave this a round 2:\n\n1. I created this guy without looking at any sort of picture for reference. I should have made the beak less square, and more oval.\n2. The white \u201cbib\u201d piece is way too thick.\n3. The feet needed to be slightly smaller, more separated, and pointed outwards.\n4. The top of his head should have a little more length to it.\n5. The eyes are slightly different in size, and I should have gone with my instinct and added expression.\n6. I forgot to make the nose holes!\n7. His body is tilted slightly backwards, and I\u2019d like it better if it were more perpendicular.\n8. My use of glaze was not wise. It would have added most to the piece if his eyes and beak had a slight glaze, and possibly the white part of his body, and nothing else.\n\n\n","html":"<p>My excitement about fixing up an old Thinkpad T30 and installing a Linux OS has inspired me to create Tux the penguin out of clay.<\/p>\n<p>1.

Eyes are fairly easy &#8211; two small white circles, and then two slightly smaller black circles for the pupils.  You can use the eyes to convey expression.  For mine, since this guy is a graphic, I went with a generic stare.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00018x.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-375\" title=\"6.

Separate the remaining black clay into two pieces, and roll each piece into a 3\/4 inch log.  Flatten one end slightly more than the other to get the &#8220;flipper shape&#8221; below.  To attach them, I like to make X&#8217;s on the back of the surface being attached, and the surface I am attaching to.  I then take a rounded tool and work the edges together, as you can see below.  After merging, you can use your finger or a smooth tool to get rid of the rough edges.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00019x.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-376\" title=\"7.

In retrospect I would have made the flippers thinner at the top as well.  It&#8217;s a delicate balance of making the piece substantial enough to not crack immediately when\/after it&#8217;s baked, and making things tiny\/delicate\/thin\/beautiful!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00020x.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-377\" title=\"8.

To make the feet, I mixed some more yellow and white, and formed two small balls to attach to his bottom for &#8220;legs&#8221; (as you can see on the left).  I then made two slightly larger balls and formed them into thin isosceles triangles.  I put the triangles together, side by side, with the smallest angles touching at the bottom.  This is the corner that will be integrated with the leg stubs.  On the top, I pinched together the inner edges to make a center toe, and used a pencil to indent the center of each top, creating the impression of two outside toes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tux-00021x.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-378\" title=\"9.

I should have made the beak less square, and more oval.<\/li>\n<li>The white &#8220;bib&#8221; piece is way too thick.<\/li>\n<li>The feet needed to be slightly smaller, more separated, and pointed outwards.<\/li>\n<li>The top of his head should have a little more length to it.<\/li>\n<li>The eyes are slightly different in size, and I should have gone with my instinct and added expression.<\/li>\n<li>I forgot to make the nose holes!<\/li>\n<li>His body is tilted slightly backwards, and I&#8217;d like it better if it were more perpendicular.<\/li>\n<li>My use of glaze was not wise.

The next step was to remove the metal case from the old drive, and screw it into the new one.  Remember how I mentioned the screws going into the four spots on the outside, as opposed to the top?  This is where I initially made a mistake.  I put two of the screws into the side, and when the other two wouldn&#8217;t go easily in, I figured putting them in the top slots would work just as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/thinkpad-00017x.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-574\" title=\"18.

Here are the details!\n\n**Overview**\n\nWhen doing a group analysis in FSL or SPM, if any one subject is missing coverage due to signal loss, this means that the group map will not have this area either (only voxels that ALL subjects have are included in the group analysis). This presents us with the problem of seeing a bad group mask, and not having any idea which individual subject is responsible for the loss in coverage. Since there is no methodical way to look through individual subject masks (the mask.img for each subject in the first level output directory) I created this script to help find subjects with poor coverage, and create a list of good subjects to use for the group analysis.\n\n****\n\nVariables\n\nThis matlab script checks the coverage for a group of subjects that have completed single subject analysis, and are ready for a group analysis. The script takes in:\n\n- An experiment directory (AHABII.01, DNS.01, FIGS.01, etc)\n\n- The task (Cards, Faces \u2013> block vs affect)\n\n- The number of subjects\n\n- An ROI mask that the user wants to use for group analysis (can be created in SPM with pickatlas, or however you like)\n\n- A percent coverage minimum, which is the minimum coverage of the ROI that is acceptable to include a subject in the group analysis. For example, if our mask has 5000 voxels and we specify a % coverage minimum of .95, then only subjects with .95 X 5000 voxels (minimally) will be included.\n\n**Order of Operations**\n\n1. The script first sets up output directories and paths. All output goes into N:\\(EXPERIMENT)\\Analysis\\SPM\\Second_level\\(TASK)\\Coverage_Check\\(DATE and TIME). Output folders include \u201cresults,\u201d \u201clogs,\u201d and \u201cmasks.\u201d The \u201cmasks\u201d folder will hold the raw copied masks from the single subject directory. A subfolder called \u201cROI_applied\u201d will hold these same images that have been masked by the user specified ROI. The naming convention for the ROI_applied folder is \u201cbrainmsk#.*\u201d\n\nHere we are selecting the output directory\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/1-Select-experiment-300x199.jpg \"1 Select experiment\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/1-Select-experiment.jpg)\n\nthe task\u2026\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/2-Select-task-300x263.jpg \"2 Select task\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/2-Select-task.jpg)\n\nthe number of subjects\u2026\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/3-Number-of-Subjects-300x129.jpg \"3 Number of Subjects\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/3-Number-of-Subjects.jpg)\n\nthe percent coverage desired\u2026\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/4-Percent-Coverage-281x300.jpg \"4 Percent Coverage\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/4-Percent-Coverage.jpg)\n\nthe subjects (I just chose 5 to keep it quick for this example)\u2026\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/5-Select-Subjects-300x195.jpg \"5 Select Subjects\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/5-Select-Subjects.jpg)\n\nand finally, the ROI (region of interest) mask.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/6-Select-Mask-300x202.jpg \"6 Select Mask\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/6-Select-Mask.jpg)\n\n2. We calculate the number of voxels in the ROI, and multiply that by the % coverage specified to get the minimum number of acceptable voxels for each subject.\n\n3. The subject data (the mask.img and mask.hdr file) is copied from the Analysis directory of each subject into the output directory under \u201cmasks.\u201d Each subject is assigned a mask number, so the new files are saved as \u201cmask_#.img\u201d and \u201cmask_#.hdr.\u201d This number will be important for identifying the subject in the output text files, and matching masks with subject IDs. Here is a quick shot of the top and lower levels of a freshly run output directory:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/16-Output-folders-300x150.jpg \"16 Output folders\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/16-Output-folders.jpg)\n\n4. We use the ROI to mask the subject data, and each subject has a new mask saved under \u201cROI_applied\u201d with the prefix \u201cbrainmsk\u201d followed by the appropriate mask number. We then calculate the number of voxels in this resulting image. If we are below the threshold, the subject is flagged for review. If we are above the threshold, the subject is added to the \u201cINCLUDED\u201d list. If the mask cannot be found, the subject is added to the \u201cMISSING\u201d list. Here we are using IMCalc to mask each subject image with the ROI.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/7-IM-Calc-300x153.jpg \"7 IM Calc\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/7-IM-Calc.jpg)\n\n5. For each subject that is flagged, the user is prompted if he\/she wants to visually check the images, and if the graphical output should be printed to file. The script then displays a 3D image and a slices image for each flagged subject, and the user is asked to select if the subject should be eliminated. If the user selects to not visually check the flagged images, then all subjects flagged for elimination get placed in the eliminated list. Here is the prompt to ask the user if he\/she wants to visually check the flagged subjects (note that I recently changed this to \u201cVisual Check Flagged\u201d):\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/8-Visual-Check-Option-286x300.jpg \"8 Visual Check Option\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/8-Visual-Check-Option.jpg)\n\nand here we ask the user if graphical output should be printed to file:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/9-print-views-to-file-287x300.jpg \"9 print views to file\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/9-print-views-to-file.jpg)\n\n6. If the user selects to print graphical output, this output gets printed to the post script (.ps) file in the top level of the output directory. Double clicking this file will convert it to PDF with Adobe Distiller.\n\nHere is a 3D view of a subject flagged for elimination, so the user can compare the individual subject mask with the area of the brain he\/she is interested in. This happens to be a VS mask, which is a big round blob \ud83d\ude1b We can see that there is a chunk taken out of the bottom of the blob, which represents an area that coverage was lost in for this particular subject.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/10-3D-View-300x272.jpg \"10 3D View\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/10-3D-View.jpg)\n\nWe then can click Slice View \u2013> \u201cView\u201d to see the slice View:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/11-Slice-View-300x271.jpg \"11 Slice View\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/11-Slice-View.jpg)\n\nand then you can see above that the user is prompted to choose to eliminate or keep the subject.\n\n7. If we eliminate the subject, they are added to the \u201cELIMINATED\u201d list. If we don\u2019t eliminate them, they are added to the \u201cINCLUDED\u201d list.\n\n8. Finally, the lists of subjects that are missing, eliminated, and included are printed to text files under \u201clogs.\u201d Each log includes the Subject ID, Mask ID number, and Voxel count for each subject. The included subjects are under (included.txt), the missing subjects are under (missing.txt), and the eliminated subjects are under (eliminated.txt). Here is a quick shot of the eliminated and included logs for the test run with 5 subjects:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/17-Text-Files-300x187.jpg \"17 Text Files\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/17-Text-Files.jpg)\n\n9. The user is shown a final \u201cgroup mask\u201d whole brain and group_ROI image in both the 3D and slices view, and these images are saved under \u201cResults\u201d with a print out.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/14-Group-Brain-3D-300x273.jpg \"14 Group Brain 3D\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/14-Group-Brain-3D.jpg)\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/15-Group-Brain-Slice-300x268.jpg \"15 Group Brain Slice\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/15-Group-Brain-Slice.jpg)\n\nand of course, the raw image files are available for all of these graphics so you can mess around with them to your heart\u2019s desire! The idea is that you would then take the list of \u201cincluded\u201d subject IDs and use those subject\u2019s in a group analysis to get the same coverage that is predicted by the script. Cool!\n\n**The script**\n\n- To run, make sure that it is saved in a scripts directory that is part of your MATLAB path. Our standard is to save it under DNS.01\/Scripts\/MATLAB\n\n- To run, simply type \u201ccov_check()\u201d in the MATLAB window, and it will prompt you for all of your variables\n\n- cov_check: I\u2019m unfortunately not going to post it on here, because I\u2019m not sure about the rules of scripts and lab property. If you are curious about the script, however, I\u2019d be glad to share!\n\n\n","html":"<p>Haha, this is my first little go at releasing something that is moderately useful, a script that helps FSL or SPM users check the coverage for each single subject before jumping into a group analysis.

A subfolder called &#8220;ROI_applied&#8221; will hold these same images that have been masked by the user specified ROI.

We calculate the number of voxels in the ROI, and multiply that by the % coverage specified to get the minimum number of acceptable voxels for each subject.<\/p>\n<p>3.  The subject data (the mask.img and mask.hdr file) is copied from the Analysis directory of each subject into the output directory under &#8220;masks.&#8221; Each subject is assigned a mask number, so the new files are saved as &#8220;mask_#.img&#8221; and &#8220;mask_#.hdr.&#8221; This number will be important for identifying the subject in the output text files, and matching masks with subject IDs.  Here is a quick shot of the top and lower levels of a freshly run output directory:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/16-Output-folders.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-602\" title=\"16 Output folders\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/16-Output-folders-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>4. We use the ROI to mask the subject data, and each subject has a new mask saved under &#8220;ROI_applied&#8221; with the prefix &#8220;brainmsk&#8221; followed by the appropriate mask number. We then calculate the number of voxels in this resulting image. If we are below the threshold, the subject is flagged for review. If we are above the threshold, the subject is added to the &#8220;INCLUDED&#8221; list. If the mask cannot be found, the subject is added to the &#8220;MISSING&#8221; list.  Here we are using IMCalc to mask each subject image with the ROI.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/7-IM-Calc.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-593\" title=\"7 IM Calc\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/7-IM-Calc-300x153.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"153\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>5. For each subject that is flagged, the user is prompted if he\/she wants to visually check the images, and if the graphical output should be printed to file. The script then displays a 3D image and a slices image for each flagged subject, and the user is asked to select if the subject should be eliminated. If the user selects to not visually check the flagged images, then all subjects flagged for elimination get placed in the eliminated list.  Here is the prompt to ask the user if he\/she wants to visually check the flagged subjects (note that I recently changed this to &#8220;Visual Check Flagged&#8221;):<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/8-Visual-Check-Option.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-594\" title=\"8 Visual Check Option\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/8-Visual-Check-Option-286x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>and here we ask the user if graphical output should be printed to file:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/9-print-views-to-file.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-595\" title=\"9 print views to file\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/9-print-views-to-file-287x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>6. If the user selects to print graphical output, this output gets printed to the post script (.ps) file in the top level of the output directory.

Finally, the lists of subjects that are missing, eliminated, and included are printed to text files under &#8220;logs.&#8221; Each log includes the Subject ID, Mask ID number, and Voxel count for each subject. The included subjects are under (included.txt), the missing subjects are under (missing.txt), and the eliminated subjects are under (eliminated.txt).

Thus,  results viewed using the PickAtlas Tool will include a small volume  correction that will be reflected in the p-values.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this was there  before &#8211; but there is a &#8220;Generate Table&#8221; button that allows you to  select one or more analyze images with an ROI, and it spits out a table  with the following statistics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Size<\/li>\n<li>Average<\/li>\n<li>Std.Dev.<\/li>\n<li>T<\/li>\n<li>Region<\/li>\n<li>ROI name<\/li>\n<li>L\/R\/B<\/li>\n<li>Study<\/li>\n<li>Image<\/li>\n<li>Max Value<\/li>\n<li>Max Loc<\/li>\n<li>Min Value<\/li>\n<li>Min Loc<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These definitely might be useful!<\/p>\n<p>Everything else is the same &#8211; it still does talarach\/MNI  coordinates, allows for dilation and shapes, right vs left selection,  all that good stuff!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitrc.org\/projects\/wfu_pickatlas\/\" target=\"_blank\">Download PickAtlas 3.0 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Happy PickAtlasing everyone!<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sun, 01 Aug 2010 11:50:27 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 21:10:24 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 01 Aug 2010 11:50:27 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":628,"title":"Once and Forever","slug":"once-and-forever","markdown":"\nVibrance and rapture, epiphany and sound  \n Gummy and splendor, elegance and bound  \n Constant in motion, mind in a whirl  \n Responsibility of a woman, heart of a girl\n\nGlowing the night lamp, hard fall the eyes  \n Gentacular hum of the heater subside  \n Blanket the darkness, creep out the mind  \n Uncover that which to day is blind\n\nEnveloped by passion, research abound  \n No chance to pause, no heart to be found\n\nBut near draw the night, a moment of clear  \n Escape from the heart a memory so dear  \n Four years past, sunshine and snow  \n Imprinted in memory, a face does not go\n\nQuiet in weakness, imprinted by heart  \n Destined to find, and be jostled apart  \n A chance of a voice, a hint of a scent  \n Painful to suppress that which is meant\n\nNever again, vows before dream  \n Comfort in one, spot, bed, and seam  \n Anew springs the day, no time to feel  \n Covered up gently, this Achilles heel\n\nStronger to face, resilient to go  \n Naive to unwilling, I never shall know  \n Sunsets in play, day night and sky  \n That which is strong wrenching to cry\n\nBurgeon my senses, mind, soul and heart  \n loving you forever, though forever apart\n\n\n","html":"<p>Vibrance and rapture, epiphany and sound<br \/>\nGummy and splendor, elegance and bound<br \/>\nConstant in motion, mind in a whirl<br \/>\nResponsibility of a woman, heart of a girl<\/p>\n<p>Glowing the night lamp, hard fall the eyes<br \/>\nGentacular hum of the heater subside<br \/>\nBlanket the darkness, creep out the mind<br \/>\nUncover that which to day is blind<\/p>\n<p>Enveloped by passion, research abound<br \/>\nNo chance to pause, no heart to be found<\/p>\n<p>But near draw the night, a moment of clear<br \/>\nEscape from the heart a memory so dear<br \/>\nFour years past, sunshine and snow<br \/>\nImprinted in memory, a face does not go<\/p>\n<p>Quiet in weakness, imprinted by heart<br \/>\nDestined to find, and be jostled apart<br \/>\nA chance of a voice, a hint of a scent<br \/>\nPainful to suppress that which is meant<\/p>\n<p>Never again, vows before dream<br \/>\nComfort in one, spot, bed, and seam<br \/>\nAnew springs the day, no time to feel<br \/>\nCovered up gently, this Achilles heel<\/p>\n<p>Stronger to face, resilient to go<br \/>\nNaive to unwilling, I never shall know<br \/>\nSunsets in play, day night and sky<br \/>\nThat which is strong wrenching to cry<\/p>\n<p>Burgeon my senses, mind, soul and heart<br \/>\nloving you forever, though forever apart<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sun, 01 Aug 2010 19:17:13 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 04 Jan 2014 23:15:48 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 01 Aug 2010 19:17:13 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":635,"title":"Sites","slug":"sites","markdown":"\nI am an active developer for [NeuroVault,](http:\/\/www.neurovault.org)\u00a0contribute significantly to the [Cognitive Atlas](http:\/\/www.cognitiveatlas.org)\u00a0and maintain the [Goggles Optional](http:\/\/www.gogglesoptional.com) site.

It used to be one of my weekly duties, and I handed my scripts over to an undergrad to take charge of. However, it stayed with me how tedious the entire process was, and I added it to my list to create a better way, when I found the time!\n\nI\u2019m happy to announce the release of send_brains.m \u2013 a matlab script that I wrote to automatically create AND send brain images. While this isn\u2019t like the coverage checking script in that it would be easy to run \u201cas is\u201d for another lab, with some modifications it could easily be used. It has a couple really cool features, including using an SPM function called \u201cslover\u201d to prepare axial and sagittal views of a high resolution anatomical, saving .jpg and .zip files, and sending an email directly from MATLAB.\n\n**What Does it Do?**\n\nThe script looks at subjects that have been Processed (through the BOLD processing pipeline that I created for our lab), and compares this list with completed brain images in a folder where all brain image output is stored. Subjects that are in the Processed folder but not in the Brain Images folder are added to a list of potential sendees.\n\n**How Do I Run It?**\n\n- To run the script, make sure that you have its path added. We have a Script folder with many subfolders, so if you have something similar, it\u2019s easiest to add the path with subfolders : addpath(genpath(\u2018Your\/path\/here\/\u2019));\n- To run, simply type brain_images on the MATLAB command line.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\n1. The script first creates the list of potential sendees \u2013 whoever has been newly processed that week and does not have a brain image created yet.\n2. The script then presents this list to the user in a graphical window, and the user can select subjects to send brain images to by highlighting the user IDs. (updated 10\/12\/2010) ( The old method asked the user if he\/she would like to delete any participants, and the user had to enters the ID into the GUI, and then the script would present the user with the new list. I wanted to make this easier so I changed it.)\n3. Next, the script looks for the processed anatomical in the subject\u2019s anat directory under Processed. This image will normally always have the same name \u2013 however in rare cases when the name is different, for whatever reason, the script will not find the highres, and will present the user with a GUI to select the image that he\/she would like to use for that participant. It then prepares two slice views of the highres, crops them, puts them together as a zip, moves the zip to the Graphics\/Brain Images folder, and cleans up the old files.\n4. Once all brain image zips have been created, the script prompts the user if he\/she wants to send a brain image for each subject, and asks the user to enter the email. This process is fairly rapid and easy. In the case that the user mistypes an email, the easiest thing to do is delete the output image, and quickly run the script again.\n5. As each address in entered, the script sends the email directly from MATLAB.\n\n**Instructions**\n\n**1. **Run by typing \u201csend_brains\u201d into MATLAB. Select your experiment top directory.\n\n**[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/1-Select-Experimentjpg-300x293.jpg \"1 Select Experiment\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/1-Select-Experimentjpg.jpg)**  \n**2**. Select your brain images output folder:  \n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/2-Select-Output-Directory-300x240.jpg \"2 Select Output Directory\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/2-Select-Output-Directory.jpg)  \n**3. **Select the subjects that you want to send images to from the GUI. In the case that the standard highres is not present for a subject, the script will prompt you to choose another file, or select \u201ccancel\u201d to skip the subject.  \n**4. **Go have a sandwich. The script will now first create a slices image with a logo overlay for each participant\u2026  \n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/4-Slices-and-Logo-199x300.jpg \"4 Slices and Logo\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/4-Slices-and-Logo.jpg)  \n**5. **\u2026and then a sagittal slices view.  \n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/5-Sagittal-View-240x300.jpg \"5 Sagittal View\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/5-Sagittal-View.jpg)  \n**6.** When everyone\u2019s images have been created and intermediate files cleaned up, then you will be prompted for each subject if you want to send a brain image or not:  \n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/6-Send-Image-Prompt-300x195.jpg \"6 Send Image Prompt\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/6-Send-Image-Prompt.jpg)  \n**7. **and then lastly you enter the participant\u2019s email.

However, the key point is that you don\u2019t have to do anything!

It used to be one of my weekly duties, and I handed my scripts over to an undergrad to take charge of.  However, it stayed with me how tedious the entire process was, and I added it to my list to create a better way, when I found the time!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce the release of send_brains.m &#8211; a matlab script that I wrote to automatically create AND send brain images.  While this isn&#8217;t like the coverage checking script in that it would be easy to run &#8220;as is&#8221; for another lab, with some modifications it could easily be used.  It has a couple really cool features, including using an SPM function called &#8220;slover&#8221; to prepare axial and sagittal views of a high resolution anatomical, saving .jpg and .zip files, and sending an email directly from MATLAB.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Does it Do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The script looks at subjects that have been Processed (through the BOLD processing pipeline that I created for our lab), and compares this list with completed brain images in a folder where all brain image output is stored.   Subjects that are in the Processed folder but not in the Brain Images folder are added to a list of potential sendees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How Do I Run It?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> To run the script, make sure that you have its path added.  We have a Script folder with many subfolders, so if you have something similar, it&#8217;s easiest to add the path with subfolders :  addpath(genpath(&#8216;Your\/path\/here\/&#8217;));<\/li>\n<li>To run, simply type brain_images on the MATLAB command line.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The script first creates the list of potential sendees &#8211; whoever has been newly processed that week and does not have a brain image created yet.<\/li>\n<li>The script then presents this list to the user in a graphical window, and the user can select subjects to send brain images to by highlighting the user IDs. (updated 10\/12\/2010) ( The old method asked the user if he\/she would like to delete any participants, and the user had to enters the ID into the GUI, and then the script would present the user with the new list.  I wanted to make this easier so I changed it.)<\/li>\n<li>Next, the script looks for the processed anatomical in the subject&#8217;s anat directory under Processed. This image will normally always have the same name &#8211; however in rare cases when the name is different, for whatever reason, the script will not find the highres, and will present the user with a GUI to select the image that he\/she would like to use for that participant. It then prepares two slice views of the highres, crops them, puts them together as a zip, moves the zip to the Graphics\/Brain Images folder, and cleans up the old files.<\/li>\n<li>Once all brain image zips have been created, the script prompts the user if he\/she wants to send a brain image for each subject, and asks the user to enter the email. This process is fairly rapid and easy. In the case that the user mistypes an email, the easiest thing to do is delete the output image, and quickly run the script again.<\/li>\n<li>As each address in entered, the script sends the email directly from MATLAB.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Instructions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. <\/strong>Run by typing &#8220;send_brains&#8221; into MATLAB.

Other variables in Plink include individual and family IDs and the allele combo that each participant has for each SNP. It was a pretty cumbersome process to take the output produced by this program (a strangely formatted .list file) and wrestle with it to get it into excel columns, and then come up with some custom (likely error prone) process to match the many subject family and individual identifiers with whatever identifier is used in the study. This script makes that process, which might have taken someone an hour, complete in under a minute!\n\nThis script reads in a .list file created with the software program \u201cPlink\u201d and allows the user to select SNPs that he\/she is interested in, as well as a subject ID lookup table, and a gene reference table. The script matches the study IDs with the correct participants, as well as appends the gene identifier to the name of each SNP. The output is a .csv file for easy import into Excel, SPSS, etc. The name of the output file is the name of the list file appended with the date.\n\n**Running the Script**\n\n1. Save the script to your directory of choice, and prepare a .list file, and optionally, a subject lookup table and a genetic reference file.\n2. Either add the location of the script as a path (addpath(genpath(\u2018mypath\u2019)), or navigate to where the script is to run it.\n3. To run, simply type \u201cPlink_View\u201d on the MATLAB command line. You can either run with no input arguments, or specify your listfile and lookup table as arguments 1 and 2, respectively. Here are your choices:\n\n- Plink_View \u2013 will be prompted for listfile, lookup, and ref\n\n- Plink_View(listfile) \u2013 will not have gene names and other_IDs\n\n- Plink_View(listfile,lookup) \u2013 will not have gene names\n\n- Plink_View(listfile,lookup,ref) \u2013 will have gene names and other_IDs\n\n**Variables**\n\n- ** listfile**: Must be a .list file generated by plink, with each row listing the gene identifier, the SNP name, the allele combo, and then groups of family IDs followed by individual IDs. The script expects various allele combos for each SNP (11, 12, 22, 00) and family IDs to be followed by the individual ID.\n\n- **lookup: ** Must be an excel file (.xls\/.xlsx) with two columns \u2013 it is OPTIONAL. The individual identifier should be in the first column, and the \u201cother_ID\u201d in the second column. The user is allowed to select if he\/she would like to lookup by individual ID, family ID, or Family_Individual ID (the concatenation of the two).\n\n- **ref**: is an rs_gene_reference excel (.xls\/.xlsx) document that is OPTIONAL. It should be formatted so that the first column has the SNP name, and the second column has the gene symbol. If the user specifies a gene reference file, then the gene symbol is appended to the SNP name in the output table. If not, the output table will only have the SNP name.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\n****1. The script starts by evaluating how much information the user has provided. In the case of zero arguments, it prompts the user for all of the input variables (giving the choice to add the lookup table and gene reference table, since those two are optional!) In the case that input arguments are provided on the command line, it goes right into step 2.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/1-Select-list-file-150x150.jpg \"1 Select list file\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/1-Select-list-file.jpg) [![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/2-Choose-lookup-table-150x150.jpg \"2 Choose lookup table\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/2-Choose-lookup-table.jpg) [![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/3-Lookup-table-file-150x150.jpg \"3 Lookup table file\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/3-Lookup-table-file.jpg) [![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/Lookup-By-Choice-150x150.jpg \"Lookup By Choice\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/Lookup-By-Choice.jpg) [![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/4-gene-reference-table-choice-150x150.jpg \"4 gene reference table choice\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/4-gene-reference-table-choice.jpg) [![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/5-Gene-Reference-Table-150x150.jpg \"5 Gene Reference Table\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/5-Gene-Reference-Table.jpg)\n\n2. The script reads the second column of the list file, which is always the long list of SNPs. Regardless of the number of repeats of each SNP (based on the number of allele combos) the script presents the user with a popup GUI with a complete list of the SNPs. The user is allowed to select the SNPs from the list that he\/she wants included in his\/her output file.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/6-Select-SNPs-133x300.jpg \"6 Select SNPs\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/6-Select-SNPs.jpg)\n\n3. The script then loads the genetic reference table, and matches each chosen SNP with its gene. These names are saved into another variable for use in the creation of the output file. They will be the headers for each SNP. For example, if a SNP is called rs16 and it is from the gene \u201cTHSD7A\u201d, the column header that includes each subject\u2019s allele will have the title \u201crs16_THSD7A.\u201d In the case that the user does not use a gene reference table, the name will simply be \u201crs5522.\n\n4. The script next delves into the task of reading the data. This is reliant on Plink producing a consistently formatted output .list file. Here is a sample output with two SNPs (shortened of course!):\n\n7 rs16 11 7612 1 6931 1 3658 1 4346 1 9744  \n 7 rs16 12 941 1 8955 1 9705 1 7220 1 9232 1 5650 1 698 1  \n 7 rs16 22 5966 1 9412 1 9519 1 5922 1 2772 1 7129 1 5537 1  \n 7 rs16 00  \n 7 rs8 11 7680 1 7468 1 3862 1 4992 1  \n 7 rs8 12 8955 1 9519 1 5922 1 4346 1 8796 1 8905 1 8702 1  \n 7 rs8 22 941 1 7612 1 5966 1 6931 1 9412 1 9705 1 3658 1 7220 1 \\\\ 7 rs8 00 6904 1 7312 1 7393 1\n\nEach line follows the following format:\n\n(gene) (SNP) (allele) (family ID 1) (individual ID 1) (family ID 2) (Individual ID 2)\u2026 etc\n\n5. The script reads in one line, one element at a time, skipping over the (gene). This is done by locating the next empty space, and then referencing the line from the start to that space -1. When an element has been read and saved to a temporary variable, it is cut from the beginning of the line.\n\n6. The SNP name is added only in the case that the user indicated wanting it. A DATA structure is created that holds the various fields of each person. In the case that we have a .list file with multiple SNPs, it is very likely that an individual will appear twice. So each person is read in with their family and individual ID, and then searched for in the structure. In the case that they already exist, the new SNP information is added. In the case that they don\u2019t exist, a new subject is added with the new family and individual ID.\n\n7. Once all subjects and their SNPs have been added, the script loads the study ID lookup table, and goes through each subject saved in the DATA structure, searching for a matching ID in the lookup table. In the case that the ID is found, it is placed into the \u201cStudy_ID\u201d field for the subject. In the case that it is not found, this field will remain blank.\n\n8. The last step is printing all of the data to a .csv file with the proper headers and comma placement. The script gives the .csv file the same name as the list file provided by the user appended with the date.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/7-Sample-Output-File-287x300.jpg \"7 Sample Output File\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/7-Sample-Output-File.jpg)\n\n[View the Script](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/LONG\/Vanessa\/MATLAB\/Plink\/Plink_View.m \"Plink_View\")  \n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/8-Thank-you-come-again-150x73.jpg \"8 Thank you come again!\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/8-Thank-you-come-again.jpg)\n\n\n","html":"<p>When doing any sort of genetic analysis, we use a program called Plink to read in subject data from a .ped\/.map file, and help us pull the SNPs that we are interested in.

For example, if a SNP is called rs16 and it is from the gene &#8220;THSD7A&#8221;, the column header that includes each subject&#8217;s allele will have the title &#8220;rs16_THSD7A.&#8221; In the case that the user does not use a gene reference table, the name will simply be &#8220;rs5522.<\/p>\n<p>4. The script next delves into the task of reading the data. This is reliant on Plink producing a consistently formatted output .list file. Here is a sample output with two SNPs (shortened of course!):<\/p>\n<p>7 rs16 11 7612 1 6931 1 3658 1 4346 1 9744<br \/>\n7 rs16 12 941 1 8955 1 9705 1 7220 1 9232 1 5650 1 698 1<br \/>\n7 rs16 22 5966 1 9412 1 9519 1 5922 1 2772 1 7129 1 5537 1<br \/>\n7 rs16 00<br \/>\n7 rs8 11 7680 1 7468 1 3862 1 4992 1<br \/>\n7 rs8 12 8955 1 9519 1 5922 1 4346 1 8796 1 8905 1 8702 1<br \/>\n7 rs8 22 941 1 7612 1 5966 1 6931 1 9412 1 9705 1 3658 1 7220 1 \\\\ 7 rs8 00 6904 1 7312 1 7393 1<\/p>\n<p>Each line follows the following format:<\/p>\n<p>(gene) (SNP) (allele) (family ID 1) (individual ID 1) (family ID 2) (Individual ID 2)&#8230; etc<\/p>\n<p>5. The script reads in one line, one element at a time, skipping over the (gene). This is done by locating the next empty space, and then referencing the line from the start to that space -1. When an element has been read and saved to a temporary variable, it is cut from the beginning of the line.<\/p>\n<p>6. The SNP name is added only in the case that the user indicated wanting it. A DATA structure is created that holds the various fields of each person. In the case that we have a .list file with multiple SNPs, it is very likely that an individual will appear twice. So each person is read in with their family and individual ID, and then searched for in the structure. In the case that they already exist, the new SNP information is added. In the case that they don&#8217;t exist, a new subject is added with the new family and individual ID.<\/p>\n<p>7. Once all subjects and their SNPs have been added, the script loads the study ID lookup table, and goes through each subject saved in the DATA structure, searching for a matching ID in the lookup table. In the case that the ID is found, it is placed into the &#8220;Study_ID&#8221; field for the subject. In the case that it is not found, this field will remain blank.<\/p>\n<p>8. The last step is printing all of the data to a .csv file with the proper headers and comma placement. The script gives the .csv file the same name as the list file provided by the user appended with the date.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/7-Sample-Output-File.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-701\" title=\"7 Sample Output File\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/7-Sample-Output-File-287x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Plink_View\" href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/LONG\/Vanessa\/MATLAB\/Plink\/Plink_View.m\" target=\"_blank\">View the Script<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/8-Thank-you-come-again.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-702 alignleft\" title=\"8 Thank you come again!\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/8-Thank-you-come-again-150x73.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"73\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 13:29:28 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 04 Jan 2014 04:18:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 13:29:28 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":720,"title":"Get rid of carriage returns using tr","slug":"get-rid-of-carriage-returns-using-tr","markdown":"\nKristin recently had a script that, for some mysterious reason, was in Windows format!

This documentation will explain the contents of the folder, as well as the workings of the various scripts.\n\n**Overview of Files**\n\n**rem_email.bat** This batch script is responsible for downloading necessary appointment data from the private server, and running the matlab scripts to send out reminder and confirmation notifications. The script would be run nightly to ensure that new files have been downloaded and we have the most up to date information. It basically maps a drive to download new data, runs the matlab scripts to send out reminders, deletes temporary files produced by the scripts, and then closes the mapped drive. The script is as follows (with all paths and such replaced with text):\n\n\n## [rem_email.m](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/vsoch\/8251564)\n\n**schedule.csv:** Is scheduling information saved on a private server which we connect to and download for the scripts.\n\nTakes in the following arguments: rem_email(days,cal,sendtxt,sendemail,contactemail)\n\n- days: This is the number of days in advance that the reminder emails will be sent. (1 = 24 hrs, 2 = 48 hrs, etc)\n\n- calendars: This is the calendar name that the reminders will be sent to, for each of the times indicated. This can currently be \u201cComputer\u201d or \u201cImaging.\u201d\n\n- sendtxt: \u2018yes\u2019 indicates we want to send a text message, no means no!\n\n- sendemail: \u2018yes\u2019 indicates we want to send an email, no means no!\n\n- contactemail: (optional) An email address that you want to be notified in the case of error\n\nThis script depends on the imaging and computer calendars to be formatted with the participant first and last name in the Title (Summary) field, and the appointment information copied from the clinical calendar into the description field the following format:\n\nName: Jane Doe  \n Phone: (999) 999-9999  \n E-mail: jane.doe@duke.edu\n\n**The script works as follows:**\n\n1. Downloads the latest computer or imaging calendar based on a private ical address, and saves the data as either \u2018imaging.txt\u2019 or \u2018computer.txt.\u2019\n2. Reads schedule.csv (just downloaded) into matlab. In the case that this file doesn\u2019t exist (due to a download error, etc) it records this into the error log, and contacts the \u2018contactemail\u2019 about the error.While reading in information from the calendar file, the script places the participant name, and appointment date and time into a structural array ONLY for appointments in the future.\n3. All of this data is read in from particular locations in the calendar file, and formatted between numbers and strings so we can both do calculations (numbers) and print the variables (strings) into text in reminder emails, etc.\n4. Important Notes about the formatting of the calendar: In the case that the script cannot find the person\u2019s name as the first field under \u201cDescription\u201d \u2013 it extracts it from the \u201cSUMMARY\u201d field \u2013 which is like the Title of the event on the calendar. If both these locations are missing the participant name, the script will exit with error\n5. The script next uses the fields from the schedule.csv file as a lookup table, and finds participants by first and last name to match with individuals with future appointments only. Currently, we have no third check, so if two people have the exact same name, the script will find the one that appears earliest in the file. This hasn\u2019t been an issue thus far, but if it becomes an issue I will troubleshoot a solution.\n6. As the script matches participants in the structure (read in from the calendar file) with additional information read from the schedule.csv, it updates the structure, so at the end of this process we have a complete structural array with information for all subjects with future imaging or computer appointments. Since these are scheduled always within a week of the clinical appointment and never greater than a week apart, this structure should never get greater than perhaps 30. Even if it did, it wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n7. Once we have this complete structure, we then need to figure out who to contact.\n8. The script looks at the \u201cdays\u201d variable, specified by the user, which is the number of days in advance to send the reminder for. It converts the date of the present date into a number, adds the \u201cdays\u201d variable to that, and creates a \u201ccompare_date\u201d variable.\n9. We then cycle through the structural array of participants, and convert each person\u2019s appointment date to a number, and then compare this number to the comparedate. In the case that we have a match (meaning that the participants appointment is indeed X (days) away, then we send the email.\n10. If the person has indicated that it\u2019s OK to text message them, and the script is set to sent text reminders (determined by the sendtxt variable) then we also use the script send_text_messages to send the text reminders.\n11. Depending on whether we are doing the imaging or computer calendar, the email message varies in telling the participant the appointment type (\u201cImaging\u201d or \u201cComputer\u201d) and the location to meet the experimenter.\n12. We then record all participants contacted to an output log, and exit matlab to prepare for the next script.\n13. The rem_email.bat file can send out different combinations of reminder emails and texts simply by running this script multiple times with various configurations, as is done if you look at the batch code above.\n\n\n## [confirmation_email.m](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/vsoch\/8251564)\n\nTakes in the following arguments: confirmation_email(contactemail)\n\nThis script works in the same basic manner as rem_email.m, except that it is hard coded to download the imaging and computer calendar, and then send out only reminder emails to subjects with appointments that were just created in the past 24 hours (new appointments that should be confirmed). It figures out this detail by reading in the CREATED field from the calendar text files, which contains the date and time of when the event was created on the calendar. Output goes to a second output log, and in case of error, the contactemail is notified.\n\n**imaging.txt:** Is a temporary file created in an ical format (saved as a text for easy readability) that contains information from our imaging calendar on Gmail. This file is created by the script (if it doesn\u2019t exist) and deleted at the end of the batch job.**  \n**\n\n**computer.txt: ** Is the equivalent temporary file, but for the computer battery calendar.  \n various LOG.txt files: Are output logs and error logs of reminder emails and texts sent. To be updated upon each script run.\n\nThese are new scripts, of course, and should be checked regularly for successful runs, and in the case of error, troubleshooted! In the long run I am hoping these will provide an easy and reliable toolset for sending reminder emails and text messages to participants, and doing away with missed appointments!\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;ve worked about 35 hours in the past four days putting together an automated reminder system for our lab.

For example, if we input (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) we should get the following subsets:\n\n- 1 + 2 = 3\n- 1 + 3 = 4\n- 2 + 4 = 6\n- 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n\nand the count is 4. The set of numbers that is provided to use is:\n\n- (3,4,9,14,15,19,28,37,47,50,54,56,59,61,70,73,78,81,92,95,97,99)\n\nFor this question I couldn\u2019t immediately sit down and start working. I knew that I needed to do some reading up on sets. I first refreshed my memory about powersets \u2013 a powerset of a set is all the possible subsets. So, for example, if we have a set (x,y,z), the entire powerset would include: (x),(y),(z),(xy),(xz),(yz),(xyz), plus the empty set (). And very cool \u2013 there is an equation to calculate the powerset! You can get the number of subsets in the powerset by using the equation P(s) = 2 to the n, where n is the number of elements in the set. So given that the set provided by the challenge has 22 members, this means that there are 2 to the 22 possible subsets, or 4,194,304 possible answers. Holy cow! I definitely need a script to figure this out!\n\n**So what I decided to do: **\n\n1. I first check for a set that is empty or only has one member. There are no solutions in these cases. If we have more than 1 member, then I cycle through a loop for the number of iterations equal to the number of possible sets in the powerset (2 to the n, where n is the number of possible subsets). We subtract one because the loop starts at 0.\n\ncode\n\n3) We then want to find the indicies for each possible set. This means that, for each value of i, we will generate an array of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s, with a one at each spot where a member is located.\n\ncode\n\n4) We can then use these indicies to get the actual numbers from the set, and put the set into a variable.\n\ncode\n\n5) We then look at only the subsets that have greater than one member, find the largest value, and compare this value to the sum of the remaining elements. This is where the script would break if the input set wasn\u2019t ordered from least to greatest, because it assumes that the last element in the set is the largest. If the sum matches the largest member, we add it to our candidates variable (p is returned, which feeds into \u201ccandidates\u201d), and add one to the count!\n\ncode\n\n6) Lastly, if at the end of this process we haven\u2019t found any answers, we return p as an empty set, so the script notifies the user that there are no sets that fit the criteria.\n\n**Things that I would change:**\n\nI will post the script that I used to find the answer below, but I also want to talk about some tweaks that I would make to it to make it slightly more efficient. Efficiency and speed isn\u2019t something that I\u2019ve been overly concerned about, but I realize that if I want to get better, I need to start taking it into consideration. So, if I were to add to this script, I would do the following:\n\n- Possibly pre-allocate memory for the variable that holds the answers. I don\u2019t have a great understanding of this stuff, but I think that if a variable changes size on every iteration, it always has to find a new spot in memory. But on the other hand, if I allocate memory based on the largest possible subset, that would be a waste for the smaller subsets. So it\u2019s a question of whether it\u2019s better to take up more memory off the bat, or leave it to allocate on the fly.\n- Recursion! There is likely a clever way to do this recursively, and of course that would be even more efficient.\n- The challenge just needed the count of the number of subsets that match the criteria, and I decided to save them all into a variable, and then cycle through them to not only return a count, but present the largest to the user. This obviously wasn\u2019t required, and isn\u2019t necessary, and instead I could just present the \u201ccandidate_count\u201d variable to the user at the end.\n- I think that getting an ordered list was nice, but it is potentially not always going to be the case. So you would want the script to first order the numbers from least to greatest, and then perform the algorithm. That way, we can be assured that the last member of the script is always the greatest. As is, if this script was fed an out of order array, it would still assume the last number to be the greatest, and not function appropriately.\n\nHere is the full script, a la Matlab. How I love Matlab! Keep in mind that this display mucks up greater than and less than symbols.\n\ncode\n\nand here is a snapshot of finding the answer!\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/powerset_output-300x191.png \"powerset_output\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/powerset_output.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>The last challenge in the Grelin Code Challenge asks to create a script that finds all subsets of an array where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.

So, for example, if we have a set (x,y,z), the entire powerset would include: (x),(y),(z),(xy),(xz),(yz),(xyz), plus the empty set ().  And very cool &#8211; there is an equation to calculate the powerset!  You can get the number of subsets in the powerset by using the equation P(s) = 2 to the n, where n is the number of elements in the set.  So given that the set provided by the challenge has 22 members, this means that there are 2 to the 22 possible subsets, or 4,194,304  possible answers.  Holy cow!  I definitely need a script to figure this out!<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what I decided to do: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I first check for a set that is empty or only has one member.  There are no solutions in these cases. If we have more than 1 member, then I cycle through a loop for the number of iterations equal to the number of possible sets in the powerset (2 to the n, where n is the number of possible subsets).  We subtract one because the loop starts at 0.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nfor i = ( 0:(2^numel(theset))-1 )\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>3) We then want to find the indicies for each possible set. This means that, for each value of i, we will generate an array of 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s, with a one at each spot where a member is located.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nindicies = logical(bitget( i,(1:numel(theset)) ));\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>4) We can then use these indicies to get the actual numbers from the set, and put the set into a variable.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nset_holder = {theset(indicies)};\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>5) We then look at only the subsets that have greater than one member, find the largest value, and compare this value to the sum of the remaining elements.  This is where the script would break if the input set wasn&#8217;t ordered from least to greatest, because it assumes that the last element in the set is the largest.  If the sum matches the largest member, we add it to our candidates variable (p is returned, which feeds into &#8220;candidates&#8221;), and add one to the count!<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\n% if the set is greater than one element\r\nif length(set_holder{1}) > 1\r\n% find the index of the largest number, get the number\r\n% (assuming set organized least --> greatest)\r\nlargest_member = find(indicies,1,'last');\r\nlargest_member = theset{largest_member};\r\n\r\ntotal_sum=0;\r\n% get the sum of the remaining numbers\r\nset_sum = find(indicies(1:length(indicies)),'1');\r\nfor z = 1:length(set_sum)-1\r\ntotal_sum = total_sum + theset{set_sum(z)};\r\nend\r\n\r\n% if the sum of the elements matches the largest number,\r\n% add it to our output set:\r\n\r\nif (total_sum == largest_member)\r\np{candidate_count+1} = {theset{indicies}};\r\ncandidate_count = candidate_count +1;\r\nend\r\nend\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>6) Lastly, if at the end of this process we haven&#8217;t found any answers, we return p as an empty set, so the script notifies the user that there are no sets that fit the criteria.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Things that I would change:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I will post the script that I used to find the answer below, but I also want to talk about some tweaks that I would make to it to make it slightly more efficient.  Efficiency and speed isn&#8217;t something that I&#8217;ve been overly concerned about, but I realize that if I want to get better, I need to start taking it into consideration.  So, if I were to add to this script, I would do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possibly pre-allocate memory for the variable that holds the answers.  I don&#8217;t have a great understanding of this stuff, but I think that if a variable changes size on every iteration, it always has to find a new spot in memory.  But on the other hand, if I allocate memory based on the largest possible subset, that would be a waste for the smaller subsets.  So it&#8217;s a question of whether it&#8217;s better to take up more memory off the bat, or leave it to allocate on the fly.<\/li>\n<li>Recursion!  There is likely a clever way to do this recursively, and of course that would be even more efficient.<\/li>\n<li>The challenge just needed the count of the number of subsets that match the criteria, and I decided to save them all into a variable, and then cycle through them to not only return a count, but present the largest to the user.  This obviously wasn&#8217;t required, and isn&#8217;t necessary, and instead I could just present the &#8220;candidate_count&#8221; variable to the user at the end.<\/li>\n<li>I think that getting an ordered list was nice, but it is potentially not always going to be the case.  So you would want the script to first order the numbers from least to greatest, and then perform the algorithm.  That way, we can be assured that the last member of the script is always the greatest.  As is, if this script was fed an out of order array, it would still assume the last number to be the greatest, and not function appropriately.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here is the full script, a la Matlab.

Surprise! I didn\u2019t use a script. I found this question refreshing because I was able to whip out pencil and paper, and solve it that way. I first listed the numbers from 1 and 20, and the prime factors of each:\n\n<table cellpadding=\"1%\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"height: 617px;\" width=\"221\"><tbody><tr><td>**1:** 1<\/td><td>**11:** 11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**2: **2<\/td><td>**12:** 2*2*3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**3:** 3<\/td><td>**13: **13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**4:** 2*2<\/td><td>**14:** 2*7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**5:** 5<\/td><td>**15:** 3*5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**6:** 2*3<\/td><td>**16:** 2*2*2*2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**7:** 7<\/td><td>**17:** 17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**8:** 2*2*2<\/td><td>**18:** 2*3*3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**9:** 3*3<\/td><td>**19:** 19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>**10:** 2*5<\/td><td>**20:** 2*2*5<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>So, it makes sense that, if you have a number like 16 which breaks down to 2*2*2*2, this also includes the prime factors of 2 (2) and 8 (2*2*2), so since we are finding the smallest number that is divisible by the numbers 1 through 20, I would only need to include 16 (2*2*2*2) in this calculation, and that will by default be divisible by 2 and 8 as well.

Within this while loop for every odd number, we check if the number is prime. If the number is prime, we add one to the count of the prime_counter variable, which keeps track of what prime number we are currently at. When this prime_counter is equal to the user specified number, this is our solution.\n\ncode\n\n[]()  \n**Fibonacci Even Sum**\n\nThis was the first challenge that I attempted with java.

I first listed the numbers from 1 and 20, and the prime factors of each:<\/p>\n<table style=\"height: 617px;\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1%\" width=\"221\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1:<\/strong> 1<\/td>\n<td><strong>11:<\/strong> 11<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2: <\/strong>2<\/td>\n<td><strong>12:<\/strong> 2*2*3<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3:<\/strong> 3<\/td>\n<td><strong>13: <\/strong>13<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4:<\/strong> 2*2<\/td>\n<td><strong>14:<\/strong> 2*7<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5:<\/strong> 5<\/td>\n<td><strong>15:<\/strong> 3*5<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6:<\/strong> 2*3<\/td>\n<td><strong>16:<\/strong> 2*2*2*2<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>7:<\/strong> 7<\/td>\n<td><strong>17:<\/strong> 17<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>8:<\/strong> 2*2*2<\/td>\n<td><strong>18:<\/strong> 2*3*3<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>9:<\/strong> 3*3<\/td>\n<td><strong>19:<\/strong> 19<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>10:<\/strong> 2*5<\/td>\n<td><strong>20:<\/strong> 2*2*5<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>So, it makes sense that, if you have a number like 16 which breaks down to 2*2*2*2, this also includes the prime factors of 2 (2) and 8 (2*2*2), so since we are finding the smallest number that is divisible by the numbers 1 through 20, I would only need to include 16 (2*2*2*2) in this calculation, and that will by default be divisible by 2 and 8 as well.  So, when I had these listed out on paper, I just circled the largest occurrence of each prime factor, and mutiplied these together to get the answer.  I won&#8217;t put the answer here, but the numbers I multiplied were:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>(2*2*2*2)*(3*3)*(5)*(7)*(11)*(13)*(17)*(19)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a name=\"PythTheorum\"><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Pythagorean Triplet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For this problem, the instructions were to find a Pythagorean triplet that summed to 1000.  For review, a Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b< c, for which, a^(2) + b^(2) = c^(2)\n\nThis script takes an input number and outputs the Pythagorean triplet that sums to that number, if a triplet exists.  If not, it tells the user that one was not found.  I used some pretty simple algebra to solve for (c*c), and then set the two equations equal to one another, and tested for sets of a and b (see script for details).  When two values were found to satisfy the equation, this was the answer, and the script returns these three values as well as the product (a*b*c).  I logically didn't have to cycle from 1 through the number (1000) for a and b, but Matlab does this so fast it doesn't matter.\n\nThe funny thing about this script is that the documentation is much longer than the script itself!\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nfunction pythagorean_triplet(number)\r\n%--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n% this function finds a pythagorean triplet that adds up to a certain\r\n% number input by the user (number), if one exists!\r\n%\r\n% i solved the two equations, both for (c*c), and then set them equal\r\n% to one another, and cycled through potential sets of a's and b's\r\n% until a solution was found that sets both sides of the equation equal to\r\n% one another, the value of (c*c)\r\n%\r\n% equation 1:  a + b + c = 1000    --> so equation 3: c = 1000-a-b\r\n% equation 2: ((a*a)+(b*b))=(c*c)  &#8211;>; pythagorean theorum\r\n%\r\n% square equation 3    (c*c) = ((1000-a-b))*(1000-a-b))\r\n%\r\n% set equation 2 and equation 3 equal to one another, since both\r\n% equal (c*c).  numbers a and b that satisfy that equation = solution!\r\n% ((a*a)+(b*b)) = ((1000*(-a)*(-b))(1000*(-a)*(-b)))\r\n%&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-\r\n\r\nfor a=1:number\r\nfor b=1:number\r\nif (((a*a)+(b*b)) == ((number -a -b))*(number -a -b))\r\nfprintf(&#8216;%s%d\\n&#8217;,&#8217;a = &#8216;,a);\r\nfprintf(&#8216;%s%d\\n&#8217;,&#8217;b = &#8216;,b);\r\nfprintf(&#8216;%s%d\\n&#8217;,&#8217;c = &#8216;,(1000-a-b));\r\nfprintf(&#8216;%s%d\\n&#8217;,&#8217;the product is: &#8216;,(a*b*(number-a-b)));\r\nreturn;\r\nend\r\nend\r\nend\r\n\r\nfprintf(&#8216;%s%d\\n&#8217;,&#8217;there is no pythagorean triplet that adds up to &#8216;,number);\r\nend\r\n&#8220;>code<\/pre>\n<p><a name=\"PrimeCount\"><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Count Primes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This script returns the nth prime number, where n is specified by the user.  Since I had already created a function that checks if a number is prime for a previous challenge, I decided to modify that script for this task.  The script sets a counting value, j, equal to 1, and then enters a while loop that continues until the variable &#8216;done&#8217; is set to yes.  Within this while loop for every odd number, we check if the number is prime.  If the number is prime, we add one to the count of the prime_counter variable, which keeps track of what prime number we are currently at.  When this prime_counter is equal to the user specified number, this is our solution.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nfunction prime_count(number)\r\n%--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n% this function finds the nth prime number, where n = a number input\r\n% by the user\r\n%--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n% place the original number in a variable so we can reference it later\r\nprime_counter = 0;\r\n\r\n% first check if we have been given 0 or 1.\r\nif (number == 0)\r\nfprintf('%d%s\\n',number,' is not a valid input number.');\r\nreturn\r\nend\r\n\r\nif (number < 0)\r\nfprintf('please enter a positive number.\\n');\r\nreturn\r\nend\r\n\r\ndone = 'no';\r\nj = 1;\r\n\r\nwhile strcmp(done,'no')\r\n%if the number is even, skip it\r\nif (mod(j,2)==0)\r\nelse\r\n\r\n% figure out if we have a prime\r\nif (isprime(j))\r\nprime_counter = prime_counter+1;\r\nif prime_counter == number;\r\nfprintf('%s%d%s%d%s\\n','the prime number at the ',number,' spot is ',j,' and we have finished searching for primes!')\r\ndone = 'yes';\r\nend\r\nend\r\nend\r\nj = j+1;\r\nend\r\n\r\n%--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n% function isprime\r\n%\r\n% this function checks if an input number is prime by dividing by all\r\n% possible factors through the input number \/ 2.  in the case that there\r\n% is always a remainder for all these divisions, we know that the number\r\n% has to be prime, meaning that it is only divisible by 1 and itself.\r\n%--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfunction f = isprime(number_two)\r\n\r\n% if our number is even, we don't continue\r\nif mod(number_two,2)==0\r\nf = 0;\r\nreturn;\r\nelse\r\nfor i = 3:(number_two\/2)\r\nif mod(number_two,i) == 0\r\nf = 0;\r\nreturn;\r\nend\r\nend\r\nf = 1;\r\nreturn\r\nend\r\nend\r\nend\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p><a name=\"FibEvenSum\"><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Fibonacci Even Sum<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This was the first challenge that I attempted with java.

On the one hand, there is a lot of work to do, and projects that I want to be working on when the work dwindles down. On the other hand, I want to devote some time to making something nice for Christmas gifts. What is the solution to this predicament? Fudge, of course! It has the highest deliciousness \/ time-spent-making ratio, and is a relatively affordable investment since a small number of ingredients go very far. There are also no constraints on creativity, meaning no limit to what you can dream up, combination wise. Lastly, it travels and packages well, and it\u2019s a quick, no-bake delicacy, meaning that you can whip up many batches with only a pot and a pan or two.

This is also where you should assess the ratio of chocolate to sweetened condensed milk, depending on your mix-in. Subtracting condensed milk or adding chocolate bits will make the fudge more sturdy and dense, which might be good for runnier or floopy mix-ins, but you lose some of the softness and shine. For 0reos, I like to make a little denser fudge to match the cookie, but for most other things I stick to the normal ratio. Don\u2019t forget te salt \u2013 it is one of the essential ingredients to making the chocolate flavor really come out!\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/xmasfudge-00033-300x225.jpg \"9.

Add the mix-in, mix it just enough to evenly distribute, but not so much that the mix-in starts to break down. Then, plop into your prepared pan, and if you have a denser fudge, use plastic baggies to press it down flat. If you have a creamy, shiny fudge, it should be easily spreadable with a spoon or spatula.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/xmasfudge-00047-300x225.jpg \"18.

Bare, it\u2019s a little fugly. You next want to add your toppings, being sure to press in slightly so they stick, and then put in the refrigerator to chill. Do NOT put in the freezer \u2013 you will regret it! You can see below that I had already made a peppermint white chocolate version. I should note that white chocolate is a very fussy fudge base to work with. If you add a normal amount of sweetened condensed milk it will have the consistency of peanut butter, and never harden. The trick is to use more white chips, and add a little margarine and just enough sweetened condensed milk so it mixes and melts. You will want to get it off the stove as soon as it melts, otherwise it burns almost immediately. Then you have to work extremely quickly to get it into the pan, and you definitely will be pressing as opposed to spreading. But the deliciousness of white chocolate and peppermint is worth it!\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/xmasfudge-00051-300x225.jpg \"22.

It takes usually an hour to two, depending on the consistency.

Note **how the fudge is shiny and easily spreads into the pan, with a pretty texture on the top. This is all about the ratio of chocolate < > sweetened condensed milk.\n\n**12. **Place with the other pans to chill. Note that I have used the hanging aluminum foil to lift the center block from the pan, since I needed to use it for the new batch. This means that it is time to cut into squares! First, you want to hold the block in one hand, and peel away the wrapper from the bottom (as much as you can with your hand there). Then, you want to use a long, sharp knife to cut the fudge. I like to cut off the edges to give each piece a nice, clean cross section, but you don\u2019t have to. Your cutting strategy will vary based on the consistency and mix ins. I generally find that pressing and gentle rocking, and then using force to \u201cchop\u201d it works best. Smaller squares are usually preferable to consumers, and it always makes your batch go a little farther. Lastly, put them into paper wrappers or a container.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/xmasfudge-00059-300x225.jpg \"28.

This is also where you should assess the ratio of chocolate to sweetened condensed milk, depending on your mix-in.  Subtracting condensed milk or adding chocolate bits will make the fudge more sturdy and dense, which might be good for runnier or floopy mix-ins, but you lose some of the softness and shine.  For 0reos, I like to make a little denser fudge to match the cookie, but for most other things I stick to the normal ratio.

Do NOT put in the freezer &#8211; you will regret it!  You can see below that I had already made a peppermint white chocolate version.  I should note that white chocolate is a very fussy fudge base to work with.  If you add a normal amount of sweetened condensed milk it will have the consistency of peanut butter, and never harden.  The trick is to use more white chips, and add a little margarine and just enough sweetened condensed milk so it mixes and melts.  You will want to get it off the stove as soon as it melts, otherwise it burns almost immediately.  Then you have to work extremely quickly to get it into the pan, and you definitely will be pressing as opposed to spreading.

Note that I have used the hanging aluminum foil to lift the center block from the pan, since I needed to use it for the new batch.  This means that it is time to cut into squares!  First, you want to hold the block in one hand, and peel away the wrapper from the bottom (as much as you can with your hand there).  Then, you want to use a long, sharp knife to cut the fudge.  I like to cut off the edges to give each piece a nice, clean cross section, but you don&#8217;t have to.  Your cutting strategy will vary based on the consistency and mix ins.  I generally find that pressing and gentle rocking, and then using force to &#8220;chop&#8221; it works best.  Smaller squares are usually preferable to consumers, and it always makes your batch go a little farther.

However, my lab is going into the second year of what will be an annual Christmas tradition of having a \u201cHoliday Beer Tasting,\u201d and I am the official server. Last year we recorded everything on paper and had to do all the calculations manually, but this year I decided it would be cool to go a little more high tech. I of course would never pass up the opportunity to write a script!\n\nSince yesterday evening I\u2019ve whipped up and tested beerrank.m, which will take in all beer rankings, calculate averages, record raw and average data to file, and present the winners. The script works as follows:\n\n**1) Run **by typing beerrank into the matlab terminal window.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/1-Title.jpg \"1 Title\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/1-Title.jpg)\n\n**2) Input **the number of beers, and the desired name of the output file. If the output file already exists, the data will be appended to the next empty row. If the file does not exist, it will be created with all the appropriate headers (what I recommend to do!) The file will be put in whatever is your pwd (present working directory).\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/2-User-Prompt.jpg \"2 User Prompt\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/2-User-Prompt.jpg)\n\n**3) ****Input Beer Names:** A window will pop up for each of the number of beers that you have specified! In this window you should put the actual beer name. Note that this step should be done by the server whom knows the secret identify of each beer in the order that it is being served. These names will be hidden from view until the final results are displayed, and beers will be referenced as BEER 1, BEER 2, etc.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/3-Name-Input.jpg \"3 Name Input\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/3-Name-Input.jpg)\n\n**4) **Next, the user is prompted with an empty rankings table for BEER1. The ranking categories have been determined in advance, and at this point the server can start serving, and one person can input results as they are decided by each person, or you could go around the table at the end and have everyone read the ranking for each category. Note: An update to the script would be to allow the user to specify categories.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/4-Rankings-Input-200x300.jpg \"4 Rankings Input\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/4-Rankings-Input.jpg)\n\n**5) Here **is an example of input data. Numbers can be entered with spaces between them, and extra spaces on the front, end, and in between do not matter \u2013 the script will nip them in the butt! Note that there is currently no input validation \u2013 so in the case that a user entered a non numerical value anywhere other than the comments box, the script would error out when it converts the string number into a double (a type of number) with the function str2double(). This could be another future update \u2013 to save data temporarily, check it, and re-present the prompt to the user in the case of a faulty input. I also want to note that it doesn\u2019t matter how many numbers are input into each ranking \u2013 the average will be calculated nonetheless. I thought it would be unwise to ask the user to specify a number of rankings in advance, and then only accept that number!\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/5-Rankings-Example-201x300.jpg \"5 Rankings Example\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/5-Rankings-Example.jpg)\n\n**6) Output files **produced include a **RESULTS.mat**, a matrix of all the variables, which is updated as the script runs in the case that someone accidentally shuts out of it, and two excel files: one for raw data, and one for the averages.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/6-Output-Files.jpg \"6 Output Files\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/6-Output-Files.jpg)\n\n**7) **After the output files are produced, the script calculates the winners for each category, and presents them to the user, along with the revealed list of beer names. Note that I didn\u2019t do any sort of rounding or truncation for decimal points.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/7-Results-in-WIndow-294x300.jpg \"7 Results in WIndow\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/7-Results-in-WIndow.jpg)\n\n**8 ) Average Results File **contains the average ratings for each category for each beer, in the case that people are curious about 2nd, 3rd, 4th place, etc. Here is also where the comments are stored, which could be fun to save to look back on every year, if you\u2019re into that kind of thing. I should also point out that the script doesn\u2019t do anything in the case of two beers coming in at a tie \u2013 it simply keeps whichever one was found first as a winner. This is another update that could be implemented at some future point.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/8-Average-Results-File-300x121.jpg \"8 Average Results File\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/8-Average-Results-File.jpg)\n\n**9) Raw Data Results File: **I\u2019m a proponent of always having your raw data somewhere, in the case that there was an error in calculation, or the results file explodes, you still have something to work with!

However, my lab is going into the second year of what will be an annual Christmas tradition of having a &#8220;Holiday Beer Tasting,&#8221; and I am the official server. Last year we recorded everything on paper and had to do all the calculations manually, but this year I decided it would be cool to go a little more high tech. I of course would never pass up the opportunity to write a script!<\/p>\n<p>Since yesterday evening I&#8217;ve whipped up and tested beerrank.m, which will take in all beer rankings, calculate averages, record raw and average data to file, and present the winners. The script works as follows:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Run <\/strong>by typing beerrank into the matlab terminal window.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/1-Title.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-919\" title=\"1 Title\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/1-Title.jpg\" width=\"155\" height=\"81\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Input <\/strong>the number of beers, and the desired name of the output file. If the output file already exists, the data will be appended to the next empty row. If the file does not exist, it will be created with all the appropriate headers (what I recommend to do!) The file will be put in whatever is your pwd (present working directory).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/2-User-Prompt.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-920\" title=\"2 User Prompt\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/2-User-Prompt.jpg\" width=\"244\" height=\"199\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>3) <\/strong><strong>Input Beer Names:<\/strong> A window will pop up for each of the number of beers that you have specified! In this window you should put the actual beer name. Note that this step should be done by the server whom knows the secret identify of each beer in the order that it is being served. These names will be hidden from view until the final results are displayed, and beers will be referenced as BEER 1, BEER 2, etc.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/3-Name-Input.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-921\" title=\"3 Name Input\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/3-Name-Input.jpg\" width=\"202\" height=\"137\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>4) <\/strong>Next, the user is prompted with an empty rankings table for BEER1. The ranking categories have been determined in advance, and at this point the server can start serving, and one person can input results as they are decided by each person, or you could go around the table at the end and have everyone read the ranking for each category. Note: An update to the script would be to allow the user to specify categories.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/4-Rankings-Input.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-922\" title=\"4 Rankings Input\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/4-Rankings-Input-200x300.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>5) Here <\/strong>is an example of input data.

Note that there is currently no input validation &#8211; so in the case that a user entered a non numerical value anywhere other than the comments box, the script would error out when it converts the string number into a double (a type of number) with the function str2double(). This could be another future update &#8211; to save data temporarily, check it, and re-present the prompt to the user in the case of a faulty input. I also want to note that it doesn&#8217;t matter how many numbers are input into each ranking &#8211; the average will be calculated nonetheless. I thought it would be unwise to ask the user to specify a number of rankings in advance, and then only accept that number!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/5-Rankings-Example.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-923\" title=\"5 Rankings Example\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/5-Rankings-Example-201x300.jpg\" width=\"201\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>6) Output files <\/strong>produced include a <strong>RESULTS.mat<\/strong>, a matrix of all the variables, which is updated as the script runs in the case that someone accidentally shuts out of it, and two excel files: one for raw data, and one for the averages.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/6-Output-Files.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-924\" title=\"6 Output Files\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/6-Output-Files.jpg\" width=\"244\" height=\"132\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>7) <\/strong>After the output files are produced, the script calculates the winners for each category, and presents them to the user, along with the revealed list of beer names.

I should also point out that the script doesn&#8217;t do anything in the case of two beers coming in at a tie &#8211; it simply keeps whichever one was found first as a winner.

I am happy to post that I have just finished my first OOC (object oriented code) in python, and am excited to share what I\u2019ve learned!\n\nI decided to pick a simple project that would require some file reading and writing, as well as user input and standard output, since these basic ideas can be tweaked and applied towards running imaging analysis. The following script uses a text file as a template to play a game of madlib. The text file can be however you like, however the words that will be found and presented to the user for substitution should be in the format SUB_NOUN_SUB, SUB_ADJECTIVE_SUB, etc.\n\n**Here is how it works:**\n\n1. When madlib.py is called, we of course start in main(), and the madlib class makes an instance of itself (mymadlib = madlib())\n2. **mymadlib.getFile():** The user is asked to specify a text file to be used. If in the same directory, you can just type \u201cmytext.txt.\u201d If not in the same directory, the full path should be written out. The script checks to make sure that the file is a .txt or .doc file (other types could be added), and then checks if the file exists. If it does, we open it, if not, we spit out an error.\n3. **mymadlib.outputName():** We then keep asking the user for an output name until one is entered that doesn\u2019t already exist in the current directory. The output will be put in the present working directory.\n4. **mymadlib.readFile():** This function does the majority of the heavy lifting. It first reads all words in the text file into a list, and and then uses regular expressions to create an expression to match of the format (SUB_anything_SUB). Case does not matter, however there can be no spaces between the SUBs. If there is a space, the expression will get split into two when the file is read in, and then will not get matched, and will be not filled in with user input. So it\u2019s important to format the substitutions with no spaces! Underscores are fine.\n5. We then check if the length of the list is greater than zero, meaning we aren\u2019t dealing with a blank file. When I tested this, it also reported a file filled with only carriage returns as having a length of 0,m so it should skip over reading the words if the file is empty OR filled with carriage returns.\n6. We search through each word looking for the expression. If we find a word to substitute, we present it to the user with\n7. **mymadlib.getWord(): **which is referred to as self.getWord() since we are calling it within the class. This function simply prompts the user for input for whatever expression is specified between the SUB\u2019s.\n8. It returns the user\u2019s word choice, which is then insert into the list at the same spot as the original word, and then since the original word is moved one spot forward in the list, we remove it completely by using a function called pop() which can be applied to lists.\n9. When this process has been done for every SUB word, we use **mymadlib.createLib() **to print out new list to the terminal for the user to say, and also save it to our specified output file. Since this function is also called within the class, we reference it as self.createLib().\n\n**A few things that I learned:**\n\n- A class is essentially an object. You create instances of the object, and then can call functions specific to that object on your instance. So for example, since my class is called class madlib:, I can create a madlib object with a simple mymadlibname = madlib(). Then if I want to call a function in this class on my object instance, I can say mymadlibname.myfunction().\n- If we create an object and simply call the class as a script (calling madlib.py, for example) this goes directly to the main() class.\n- The if statement at the bottom is necessary because it makes sure that main() is only run if the script is being called. If madlib is just being used as an object for another script, then we don\u2019t want to call the first main().\n- The import statements at the top are basically pointing to common classes that add functionality to my script. For example, import re let\u2019s me use regular expressions. How do I feel about the ability to do this and select from a seemingly endless library of classes? \u2026like a kid in a candy store! :O)\n- Each function within the class, since we are dealing with an object, by default takes the object as an input parameter, represented as \u2018self.\u2019 If a function has multiple inputs \u2018self\u2019 MUST be the first parameter, unless it\u2019s called with the variables specified, in which case the order doesn\u2019t matter.\n- A couple of very powerful data structures include lists, dictionaries, and tuples. I created a tuple by accident, and had a lot of fun playing around with these different structures with my friend!\n- re.compile returns a MatchObject, which can be referenced with myobject.group() (to print out the entire match) and myobject.start() and myobject.end() to print the start and end locations of the match in the string.\n- Holy cow, if I just type \u201cpython\u201d into my terminal window, that allows me to play! Previously I was writing python code in a .py file, and testing it by running it.\n\nHere is the class and a sample text file, if you would like to try out my script! If you make any madlib\u2019s, send them my way and I\u2019d love to play them :O)\n\n[Madlib.py](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/vsoch\/8247992)  \n[TownStory.txt](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/LONG\/Vanessa\/SCRIPTY\/python\/townstory.txt)\n\n\n","html":"<p>In my free time I&#8217;ve been figuring out object oriented programming.

I wanted to share the start of a class that I have written (and will very likely keep modifying) in python to solve NPR Puzzle\u2019s of the Week. These puzzles commonly involve shuffling around letters in a state \/ city \/ TV show \/ etc, and re-arranging, subtracting, adding, to make something new. The way to get from some starting point to an answer is usually systematical and logical, and the limiting factor of the entire process is the human\u2019s ability to filter through massive amounts of data.\n\nSo let\u2019s say that you have the patience of a monk. You still can very likely go through hundreds of possibilities and miss the answer. With this in mind, I wanted to create a class that would help solve the puzzles. I am very much someone who enjoys developing procedure to get to a solution that might be used again, and so instead of writing a more extensive script for every puzzle, I chose to write a class. It would have basic functionalities like reading data from file, retrieving data points, getting field names, and writing output to file. I would bet that if I searched, I\u2019d find a combination of modules that I could use that would do this just fine, but I really wanted to create my own, and modify it over time to fit my needs.\n\n> **The challenge for last week was the following:** Name a city in the United States that ends in the letter S. The city is one of the largest cities in its state. Change the S to a different letter and rearrange the result to get the state the city is in. What are the city and state?\n\n**I broadly decided that I wanted the following functions in my class:**\n\n**INPUT**\n\n- setFile(): we need something to be able to make sure the file exists and is readable\n- parseData(): should be able to read in all of the data, regardless of how many columns of data we have, after checking that file has been set.\n\n**READ**\n\n- lookup(): should be able to look up a value in the data based on an x,y coordinate\n- entireRow(): we should be able to return an entire row of data at once\n- getFieldNum(): given that the number of columns isn\u2019t predictable, I want a function that tells me how many I have\n- getFieldName(): I want a function that, if called without argument, gives me all the headers \/ first entries of each field, and if given a coordinate, n, returns the header of the nth row\n\n**OUTPUT**\n\n- fileout(): sets the output name, so I can always specify what I want my results file to be called\n- writeOut(): writes to the output file, and will alert the user if the output file has not been defined\n\n**Given these functions, I decided on these class variables:**\n\n- self.file: the data file name to be read, originally set as Null\n- self.fields: will be a list holding the column titles of the data read from file\n- self.data: will be a list that holds the raw data for each column\n- self.numentries: the number of data entries (rows)\n- self.numfields: the number of fields (columns) in the file\n\n**Here is the first draft of the class**:\n\ncode\n\nI also want to note that I found functionality in the csv class. something called \u201csniffer\u201d that I am going to implement to make it possible to figure out if the data file has header info or not. Since I am still working on this, the sniffer code is currently commented out.\n\n**\u2026and here is the script that uses this class to solve the puzzle detailed above:**\n\ncode\n\nand [here is the data file](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/LONG\/Vanessa\/SCRIPTY\/python\/solvedata.txt) that I input (sans extension), which includes just under 300 of the largest cities, their respective states, and the population (didn\u2019t need this one, but threw it in since it was available) in the United States.\n\nThe second script above reads through each entry, and for each one, puts each character (made lowercase) from both the state and city into separate lists. It then removes all white spaces, and checks to see if the list lengths are equal. if they aren\u2019t, we shouldn\u2019t bother going any further. If they are, we move through one list and check each character for existence in the other. Whenever we find a match, we add one to the count. Here is where I would have added a line that removes the \u201cfound\u201d character from the second list after being found in the case that we are dealing with strings with duplicate characters. Without the check, a city with two a\u2019s would add one to the count for a state with only one a, since the a isn\u2019t removed after being found. I am aware that this could produce imperfect results, however for this early version I decided that my human eye could be the solution for any slip-ups. And honestly, I jumped the gun a bit \u2013 I was so excited to give it a test run that I didn\u2019t go back and add functionality to remove the character.\n\nThe next step looks to see if the count is equal to the length minus 1, theoretically meaning that they might match by all but one of the characters. What I wanted was a short list of city\/state contenders, and then my human eye could easily pick out the winner. I lucked out in that the script found only one possible answer, and it was the correct answer!\n\n> [\u2018Yonkers\u2019,\u2019New York\u2019,\u2019201,066\u2032]\n\nHooray! That definitely is a solution. For those familiar with python, the above output is obviously just a print of the entire row of data that fit the bill. It would be entirely do-able to add more functionality to the class and to the script that uses it to produce a more attractive output file.\n\nI will continue to work to modify this class to fit my needs for new puzzles in coming weeks. And I think that it\u2019s important to note that there is still an extremely large probability of error. Whether you are human or machine, you could always do a bad job of selecting your data. If the data file is weirdly formatted, it would have a lot of trouble being read, and I didn\u2019t make any checks for a standard format. I also assume that the first row is the header data, and it might be the case that someone uses data without headers. These are things that are on my mind that I will continue to try and improve as I learn more python.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Merry Christmas everyone!

These puzzles commonly involve shuffling around letters in a state \/ city \/ TV show \/ etc, and re-arranging, subtracting, adding, to make something new.  The way to get from some starting point to an answer is usually systematical and logical, and the limiting factor of the entire process is the human&#8217;s ability to filter through massive amounts of data.<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s say that you have the patience of a monk.  You still can very likely go through hundreds of possibilities and miss the answer.  With this in mind, I wanted to create a class that would help solve the puzzles.  I am very much someone who enjoys developing procedure to get to a solution that might be used again, and so instead of writing a more extensive script for every puzzle, I chose to write a class.  It would have basic functionalities like reading data from file, retrieving data points, getting field names, and writing output to file.  I would bet that if I searched, I&#8217;d find a combination of modules that I could use that would do this just fine, but I really wanted to create my own, and modify it over time to fit my needs.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The challenge for last week was the following:<\/strong> Name a city in the United States that ends in the letter S. The city is one of the largest cities in its state. Change the S to a different letter and rearrange the result to get the state the city is in. What are the city and state?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>I broadly decided that I wanted the following functions in my class:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>INPUT<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>setFile():  we need something to be able to make sure the file exists and is readable<\/li>\n<li>parseData():  should be able to read in all of the data, regardless of how many columns of data we have, after checking that file has been set.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>READ<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>lookup(): should be able to look up a value in the data based on an x,y coordinate<\/li>\n<li>entireRow(): we should be able to return an entire row of data at once<\/li>\n<li>getFieldNum(): given that the number of columns isn&#8217;t predictable, I want a function that tells me how many I have<\/li>\n<li>getFieldName(): I want a function that, if called without argument, gives me all the headers \/ first entries of each field, and if given a coordinate, n, returns the header of the nth row<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>OUTPUT<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>fileout(): sets the output name, so I can always specify what I want my results file to be called<\/li>\n<li>writeOut(): writes to the output file, and will alert the user if the output file has not been defined<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Given these functions, I decided on these class variables:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>self.file: the data file name to be read, originally set as Null<\/li>\n<li>self.fields: will be a list holding the column titles of the data read from file<\/li>\n<li>self.data: will be a list that holds the raw data for each column<\/li>\n<li>self.numentries: the number of data entries (rows)<\/li>\n<li>self.numfields: the number of fields (columns) in the file<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Here is the first draft of the class<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\n#!\/usr\/bin\/python\r\n\r\nimport re\r\nimport sys\r\nimport os.path\r\nimport csv\r\n\r\n# solve.py creates basic functionality for reading and writing files,\r\n# to be used to help with solving npr puzzle of the weeks!\r\n\r\nclass solve(object):\r\n\r\n#-__init__--------------------\r\n# defines object when created\r\ndef __init__(self):\r\nself.file = none     # the data file for reading\r\nself.fileout = none  # the output file name\r\nself.fields = []     # a list that holds the column titles of data from file\r\nself.data = []       # a list that holds raw data for each column\r\nself.numentries = 0  # the number of data entries (rows)\r\nself.numfields = 0   # the number of fields (columns) in the file\r\n\r\n# -__repr__-------------------\r\n# defines object when printed\r\ndef __repr__(self):\r\nif self.file and self.fileout: return &quot;&quot;%(self.file,self.fileout,self.numfields,self.numentries)\r\nif self.file and not self.fileout: return &quot;&quot;%(self.file,self.numfields,self.numentries)\r\nelse: return &quot;&quot;%(self.numfields,self.numentries)\r\n\r\n#------------------------------------------------------------\r\n# input functions\r\n#------------------------------------------------------------\r\n#-setfile---------------------\r\n# check file exists and is readable\r\ndef setfile(self,filepath):\r\ntry:\r\nself.file = open(filepath,'r')\r\nprint &quot;file &quot;

It then removes all white spaces, and checks to see if the list lengths are equal.  if they aren&#8217;t, we shouldn&#8217;t bother going any further.  If they are, we move through one list and check each character for existence in the other.  Whenever we find a match, we add one to the count.  Here is where I would have added a line that removes the &#8220;found&#8221; character from the second list after being found in the case that we are dealing with strings with duplicate characters.  Without the check, a city with two a&#8217;s would add one to the count for a state with only one a, since the a isn&#8217;t removed after being found.  I am aware that this could produce imperfect results, however for this early version I decided that my human eye could be the solution for any slip-ups.  And honestly, I jumped the gun a bit &#8211; I was so excited to give it a test run that I didn&#8217;t go back and add functionality to remove the character.<\/p>\n<p>The next step looks to see if the count is equal to the length minus 1, theoretically meaning that they might match by all but one of the characters. What I wanted was a short list of city\/state contenders, and then my human eye could easily pick out the winner.  I lucked out in that the script found only one possible answer, and it was the correct answer!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[&#8216;Yonkers&#8217;,&#8217;New York&#8217;,&#8217;201,066&#8242;]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hooray!  That definitely is a solution.  For those familiar with python, the above output is obviously just a print of the entire row of data that fit the bill.  It would be entirely do-able to add more functionality to the class and to the script that uses it to produce a more attractive output file.<\/p>\n<p>I will continue to work to modify this class to fit my needs for new puzzles in coming weeks.  And I think that it&#8217;s important to note that there is still an extremely large probability of error.  Whether you are human or machine, you could always do a bad job of selecting your data.  If the data file is weirdly formatted, it would have a lot of trouble being read, and I didn&#8217;t make any checks for a standard format.  I also assume that the first row is the header data, and it might be the case that someone uses data without headers.  These are things that are on my mind that I will continue to try and improve as I learn more python.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sat, 25 Dec 2010 09:58:16 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 22:29:31 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 25 Dec 2010 09:58:16 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":959,"title":"Peanut Butter Chip Cookies","slug":"peanut-butter-chip-cookies","markdown":"\nThis was a recipe that I found based on the ingredients that I happened to buy at Trader Joe\u2019s.

Script extracts and organizes data**: Matlab is data master, so matlab was my choice for collected the data. I wrote up a [quick script](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/vsoch\/8247814) that goes through folders for each subject where we store timeseries matrices, and based on the names and embedded data, creates a master matrix of mean values for each contrast of interest. To step back a bit, these individual subject matrices are made when we run our PPI (Psychophysiological Interactions) pipeline, which, as part of the analysis, will produce a timeseries of values for a particular contrast \/ mask. We are currently using anatomically and functionally defined masks, so the area that the values are extracted from would be based on significant activation for an entire group, and an anatomical mask like the amygdala. Anyway, this script jumps around the various folders, figures out the masks and contrasts that we have data for, and creates a mean timeseries for each. It\u2019s a harmless little scripty because it just loads data matrices and reads them, and then writes the extensive data to a .csv file for the next step.\n\n**2. Get data into web: **This next step I did manually for my mock up, but this would be incredibly easy to have done automatically, if that is what we choose. The web interface that I threw together is based on the Google Charts \/ Gapminder API, and the data is fed in live from a Google Spreadsheet. I can also code it to find a .csv file on a server somewhere, and read that data. I will decide on which one to utilize based on how often I would want this data updated, how it would be updated, and the level of security I want for the data. For the purposes of my mock up, I just imported the .csv into a google doc manually. But obviously there are very easy ways to get the data somewhere automatically! At the end of the day I can create a simple little batch script that checks for the data connection, produces the organized data matrix, formats it into a .csv, connects to somewhere to plop it, and that place that it gets plopped gets queried by the interactive chart.

I could make this a part of our site, and have a nice little interface that lets the user select the Task, the number of subjects, and I\u2019m thinking that it would be cool to also have gender and genotype as variables, but this would make the entire task a little more challenging, because that information isn\u2019t easily \u201cgrabbable\u201d from anywhere.

To make them square, instead of using a standard pan, I just put the liners together into a square one.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/1.-Prepare-Batter-300x225.jpg \"1.

There was no one to help at the post office at 5:00am on a weekday, so I had to take matters into my own hands, and clunk the handle around until it finally wiggled through.

Under these circumstances, I decided to host my own little Cupcake Challenge, and create a batch of cupcakes paired with a fun, easy, and cheap packaging strategy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Idea: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a cupcake pod for each cupcake. Mostly because I like the idea of each cupcake travelling in its own vessel.<\/li>\n<li>Make cupcakes square so corners are better anchors<\/li>\n<li>Use some sort of toothpick to anchor (either sticking through the side or pushing down)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rejected Ideas:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use one of those round, plastic expanding ball toys and anchor each cupcake into a hole (frosted side inward) and anchor cupcakes from the sides<\/li>\n<li>Put cupcakes inside of a gerbil wheel, and fill the entire center with sprinkles as a &#8220;packaging filler.&#8221; When it gets there, simply open up ball, pour out sprinkles, and remove cupcakes.<\/li>\n<li>Bake cupcakes into something that could make them more egg shaped, and use an egg carton<\/li>\n<li>Make a &#8220;cupcake hat&#8221; out of something hard and plastic, and place over cakes in a standard, rectangular box.<\/li>\n<li>Cupcakes in a tube didn&#8217;t seem like a great idea.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Procedure:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. <\/strong>Make cupcakes, put into paper liners.

When I tried to move it back, I felt the awful crunch \/ smash of one of my parcels, but I had to go through with the damage, or else all of the packages wouldn&#8217;t fall through, and I&#8217;m sure the next person would apply a significant amount of force and potentially chop one of my parcels entirely in half. There was no one to help at the post office at 5:00am on a weekday, so I had to take matters into my own hands, and clunk the handle around until it finally wiggled through. The result is the damaged shipment below, but I&#8217;m still grateful that it arrived in one piece!

The main incentive has always been being able to create something to give to someone else to show them that you value them. Baking is a way of expressing value and affection, even if the person is far away. In high school I regularly baked for my advisory and classes because it was fun, challenging, and fulfilling. In terms of my time constraints, I didn\u2019t have many. I did what I was supposed to, school-work and running wise with still plenty of free time for playing computer games and family stuffs. I hadn\u2019t yet stumbled on something that I loved so much that I would choose to do it not only for a full time job, but also in my free time.\n\nFast forward seven or eight years, and I\u2019ve stumbled on that something, in a big way. I now have a rich life filled with work that I am passionate about, but that means that free time that I\u2019m willing to allocate towards something like baking is minuscule. However, **1)** the desire to make things for people that I care about, and **2)** the love of being creative with color and design, and **3)** the enjoyment of the process of creating something from nothing, still make me want to have baking as a part of my life. The compromise is the amount of time that I\u2019m willing to spend on these projects. No longer will I devote 5 to 6 hours in a night to making a three tier cake or a perfect batch of decorated cookies. I also no longer have the bottomless pantry and complete set of tools that were present at my family\u2019s home, or the desire to spend large amounts of money on very specialized ingredient lists. The result is that I make simple things that are fun and quick, like two layered pink and green cheerio-crispies ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)\n\nI\u2019d also like to note that this is my hundredth post \u2013 hooray!\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of baked treats recently, rice crispies included!

The user can select a data file (.sav), an output folder, and whether or not results should also be merged into one file. This application simply writes the script to produce the desired output, and does NOT run the script.

The DNS Score file selector opens in the present working directory, so running it directly from Program Files will make your file selector start from there, which is not ideal.\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Create an output folder for storing the script and your results on your local machine\n2. Launch DNS Score\n3. Select your output folder, the syntax desired, whether you want a merged file, and the data in the GUI, and click CREATE SPS\n4. The .sps file will be saved to your output folder\n5.

The script that this application creates does the following, specifically for use with the Duke NeuroGenetics Study:\n\n1. \u00a0Loads user specified dataset\n2. Resolves ID confusion issues between two variables, and prints the correct ID as an integer \u201cdns_id\u201d\n3.

I feel excited, (a little nervous!), and empowered to transition into being a full time research scientist. I feel very strongly that hard work and a committment to proactively pursue my goals, even if there are bumps and challenges along the way, will lead to good things. I know that I have much to learn, and I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I feel confident in my ability to do what is right to be the best researcher that I can be.\n\nMore equal distribution between work and social stuffs is still something that many have articulated is an important component of a \u201cbalanced life,\u201d and if this is true, I still am lacking the life experience or incentives to drastically shift my priorities. I still am more excited to relaxedly work over a weekend than take an impromptu beach trip that would eat up the entirety of the time. And I\u2019m not sure that the idea of going out and drinking at some sort of happy hour is ever going to be my idea of fun. At this time in my life I still feel social fulfillment from interactions in with classmates or colleagues, and I balance out time sitting in front of a computer by going for an adventure run or bike ride. I think that there isn\u2019t a \u201cright\u201d way to be as long as you are productive and happy with how you are. I cannot say if I will be as work focused in fifteen or twenty years as I am now, but given that I am about to start on what I hope to be a long and fulfilling career in academia, I think my mental state and priorities are just right.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nI read an article recently titled [\u201cThe Cognitive Cost of Doing Things\u201d](http:\/\/lifehacker.com\/#!5798202\/the-cognitive-cost-of-doing-things) that made me reflect on my own cognitive resources and energy, and for the second part of this post I\u2019d like to review some of the ideas discussed.\n\n**Most Things Require A Catalyst, or Activation Energy:** I agree that it can be a challenge to get started on doing just about anything. I\u2019d call this motivation, and one of my greatest fears is not having the motivation to do something that I either must do, or should do because it\u2019s important. I manage this fear by starting on most things early so that I can always work on things that I want to be working on, maximize efficiency, and not work on things when I don\u2019t want to work on them. I also start early because it probably takes more cognitive energy to suppress working on something that excites me, given that I can allocate some time.\n\n** Manage Time Based on Present Desire:** In the case that I don\u2019t want to work on project vanilla, there is a pretty good chance that I want to work on chocolate, and I might return to vanilla when my desires again shift. You only get into trouble when you haven\u2019t allocated enough time to take fluctuating levels and foci of motivation into account, and you really have to force yourself to make an entire sundae when you don\u2019t fancy vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry. Ice cream headache! This is why I think that getting started on things promptly is important \u2013 you want to avoid associating your work with any sort of negative mental state that says \u201cI have to do this NOW and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d The same idea can be applied to running (forcing yourself to run up a hill when you aren\u2019t feeling it) or what you have for dinner. Forcing yourself to run up those hills, slowly over time, may make it so you can\u2019t muster up the cognitive energy to put your sneakers on in the first place, which is a much worse eventual outcome.\n\nEvery decision tree that we conceptualize definitely takes into account how decisions influence present and future happiness, and alter future incentive structures. I tend to be less impulsive for the present, more future oriented, and I place a high value on efficiency and \u201cgetting stuff done,\u201d so my advice to be kinder to yourself in the present and direct work and behavior based on present incentives may not be best for someone who would apply this mindset and only have it lead to procrastination. This is of course not a good mindset to have if you never reach a mental state where you want to jump into an activity.\n\n** When the pool is cold, just jump in:** Another phenomenon I\u2019ve noticed is when there are too many good things to work on, and I enter a mental state I like to call \u2018analysis paralysis.\u2019 It\u2019s like being in line at the Loop (or your favorite dinner place) and being unable to order because I can only choose one thing, and there are too many choices. So I stand there and\u2026 do nothing, when the reality of the situation is that many choices would make me happy, and I just need to pick one and move on. In these situations, whether I am standing in line for dinner or staring at my to-do list, it\u2019s good to be able to identify that I am spiraling into analysis paralysis, and I need to stop thinking and attempting to optimize, and just pick one. If motivation is an issue and my cognitive resources are pooping out, I can do the same thing. I try to start working on something small without thinking too much, and my brain usually gets immersed.\n\n**Distinguish between overall fit and sentiment for the task at hand: **I would also venture to say that it\u2019s completely normal to love some aspects of work, and not care so much for others. I think that good evidence of not being matched well with a job is probably a strong desire to not do most of what someone in that job should be doing most of the time. On the contrary, I think that losing track of time and experiencing that lovely state called \u201cflow\u201d serve as evidence that I love what I do. To again bring up the idea of working based on current desire, I would say that the right time to work on anything is exactly when I am excited to do so, and to stop working on something when I lose interest. And when I get to the point when something distracts me, then is a good time to take a break, or stop entirely. Working when I don\u2019t want to is neither productive nor a good mental state to associate with work, period.\n\n**Slowing-Down Energy:** The article talks about inertia as \u201ckeep(ing) doing what you\u2019ve been doing\u201d in the context of getting comfortable with routine. I\u2019d like to distinguish between the idea of getting stuck and comfortable with a routine, and someone\u2019s ability to disconnect from a task. Both could be considered the opposite of \u201cactivation energy\u201d in that it\u2019s what keeps you going \u2013 but the difference is the level of engagement. I have a hard time disconnecting from a task not because I am stuck in a mindless routine, but because I can\u2019t break my engagement. I cannot, and do not want, to peel away from things that I\u2019m working on until I\u2019ve reached \u201cthe right\u201d point when something else becomes more interesting, or my cognitive fuel tank needs a trip to the mental gas station. Breaking away from something that I want to be working on is more stressful and cognitively demanding than starting in the first place. If I stop too early, some component of fulfillment is missing, and the neglected task sits right on top of my mind. If I stop for the day with a lingering question, I will likely think about the problem throughout the evening, and into my run the next morning, and if I\u2019m lucky my mind will stumble over something new to try.\n\n**Opportunity Cost: **My brain always considers opportunity cost with regard to what else I might be doing with the time. I don\u2019t have the right neural connections so that money comes into the equation, and I will sheepishly admit that I\u2019ll usually chose work tasks over social things. Since time and productivity are the primary drivers of my incentive machine, I prioritize them above all else. If I need to or am asked to do activity X, I will always consider what else I might be doing with that time, say activity Y, and I will choose the activity that maximizes productivity or learning to improve future productivity. I will need to work hard to try and look at the world and my choices from a less practical angle, because In many situations (especially unstructured ones in an academic environment) I need to recognize that I cannot always predict what might come out of any sort of interaction. It might \u201cmake more sense\u201d beforehand to spend an evening coding or reading papers over attending a social event, but I could never predict meeting a new person or an interesting conversation that leads to an awesome new collaboration. This is a way of thinking that I have decided to proactively work on.\n\n**Altering hormonal balance:** The article talks about how we don\u2019t think about how things like stress, hormones, digestion, or breathing (basically environmental influences on our unique biochemistry) have huge implications for cognitive energy. I have three words for how I feel about this: running fixes everything! But in all seriousness, I like to think about how my living environment and people in it tax my cognitive resources, or energize them. There are people that I\u2019ve noticed make me happy and give me energy, and other people that leave me ruminating about something silly and negative, and wasting my cognitive resources. The same is true of small daily activities, or choices that I make. Going out for a morning run, regardless of how I feel beforehand, gives me energy. Staying up too late or forcing myself to do something that I don\u2019t want to do drains me of energy. Breaking from work and spending time with friends, even if it isn\u2019t the most productive choice, gives me energy. I take all these things into account. A lot of life is largely about maximizing the things that give me energy, and minimizing the things that sap me of it.\n\n**The BIG WHY:** But to dig a little deeper into this ogre onion, the next logical question is, what is the motivation underlying all of these things? Why should I even think or care about my cognitive resources, or be interested in anything at all?\n\nMy underlying motivation is a desire to understand systems so I can build them myself. If I can break something into pieces, then I can understand each one, and make something on my own, either similar or modified by putting the pieces together in a different way. If I can make things and solve problems, then I feel useful and productive, and that makes me a happy human being. So in a sense, understanding = empowerment \/ control to change my environment \u2013> verification of purpose \u2013> happiness. I know that when I am presented with a system or idea and I don\u2019t understand it, it\u2019s very troubling \/ upsetting, and I know that I am happiest when I feel challenged, and I have many things to work on and think about.\n\n**In a nutshell:** I appreciate articles like this because they remind me to think about myself, what makes me tick, and why I do things that I do. They also remind me that when I disagree with someone, or don\u2019t understand why said person\u2019s behavior differs from my own, I can usually understand the difference if I try to understand the underlying values and motivations. And on the flip side, when I perceive that someone doesn\u2019t agree with my choices as how to spend my time or allocate my cognitive resources, I hope that they consider what my incentives and values are. Even in light of disagreement, I think that people can try to logically understand one another. Given that people change, are inconsistent, and arguably more difficult to understand than a mechanical process, it is definitely worth taking the time to think about these things.\n\nFor now, I\u2019d like to close this thought bubble by saying that I am grateful for my past experience, really enjoying the present, and (I will say this in true New Englander, frontal-lobe dominant style) \u2013 \u201cI am wicked excited for the future!\u201d :OD\n\n\n","html":"<p>It is usually the case that before a big life change, I find myself in some sort of transition period with time to introspect.

For my own reference, I am going to document several procedures.\n\n**Download and compile from source**\n\n****1) downloading .tar.gz files, unzipping them with:\n\ncode\n\n2) look for README and INSTALL files, which will provide further details about specifics of the installation. Generally, the following works:\n\ncode\n\n3) The other option is to find a nice .rpm file, and have your system install it for you.\n\n**Find Something that You\u2019ve Installed**\n\nIf you install something and then another something cannot find it, it\u2019s likely not on the path. To step back, the path variable is basically a list of places that are browsed through to find files, whenever you call any command. So if you want to know if something is \u201cfindable\u201d in the terminal, you can echo $PATH to see if it\u2019s there!\n\nOf course, what if you are like me, and you install something, and then have no idea where it is? I was missing a required library for a package, so my run of .\/configure wasn\u2019t working. I read in the INSTALL file that I could specify a path to look for libraries, so to get this to work, I needed to find that path. So first I used yum to check if it was installed.\n\ncode\n\nAnd sure enough, I did indeed have it, but I had no idea where it was! Silly yum just told me that it was installed, and the version number, and not much else. So I blindly looked in the folders where the internet told me it was \u201csupposed\u201d to be, but found nothing. I then needed another strategy, and started to look at the rpm command.\n\n**Use rpm to find an installed package**\n\nYou can use the following to list all of your installed packages:\n\ncode\n\nThe command above tells the package manager to query all installed packages, and the addition of less just makes it more manageable in the terminal. The following gives you information about a specific package:\n\ncode\n\nand then to find where the little bugger is hiding, you can do:\n\ncode\n\nFrom this basic troubleshooting, I was able to find the location of my package, and then add it to the path variable. To edit your path, you want to change either .\/bash_profile or .\/bashrc \u2013 which I think are hidden files when you cd to ~.\n\n**Add package to path**\n\ncode\n\nIf you do \u201cls\u201d you won\u2019t see it, I think because it starts with a \u201c.\u201d. The basics of adding a folder to your path is appending it, and then exporting, like so:\n\ncode\n\nand then save the .bash_profile, and you will have to log out and in again for the changes to happen. If you don\u2019t want to do that, you can also type those commands into the terminal window.\n\nAnd to provide closure to my particular problem, after eight hours of compiling from source for a gazillion and one libraries, attempting to edit source code on my own, and installing different compilers to see if it made a difference, I finally admitted defeat to getting this particular package installed. However, that doesn\u2019t take away from the utility of the commands that I detailed above, nor does it qualify the time spent as a waste. I found this experience fun, and learned a very significant amount. I am continually awed by the intricate design of software and machines, and excited as my brain continues to make sense of them.\n\n**If an OS is like a religion, am I converted?**\n\nAm I converted? Well, I don\u2019t like the idea of joining an OS bootcamp and bashing the other side, because I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t enjoy them all. However, my love for the command line combined with my recent escapade of installing Ubuntu 11.04 on my Dad\u2019s old laptop and seeing huge improvements in performance has me excited. On some future date I would like to configure a system with something other than Windows, and not just do a dual boot or virtual machine. I\u2019m pretty excited about Chrome OS too, but I don\u2019t think the browser alone is ready for the type of applications that I use on a daily basis. Until then, it\u2019s back to regedit, blue screens of death, using SSH to satisfy command line urges, constant searching for the right .dll, Windows Update, and Dell Diagnostics.

So if you want to know if something is &#8220;findable&#8221; in the terminal, you can echo $PATH to see if it&#8217;s there!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, what if you are like me, and you install something, and then have no idea where it is?  I was missing a required library for a package, so my run of .\/configure wasn&#8217;t working.  I read in the INSTALL file that I could specify a path to look for libraries, so to get this to work, I needed to find that path.  So first I used yum to check if it was installed.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nyum list packagename\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>And sure enough, I did indeed have it, but I had no idea where it was!  Silly yum just told me that it was installed, and the version number, and not much else.  So I blindly looked in the folders where the internet told me it was &#8220;supposed&#8221; to be, but found nothing.  I then needed another strategy, and started to look at the rpm command.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use rpm to find an installed package<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can use the following to list all of your installed packages:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nrpm -qa | less\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>The command above tells the package manager to query all installed packages, and the addition of less just makes it more manageable in the terminal.  The following gives you information about a specific package:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nrpm -qi packagename # query for information (i)\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>and then to find where the little bugger is hiding, you can do:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nrpm -ql packagename  # query for the location (l)\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>From this basic troubleshooting, I was able to find the location of my package, and then add it to the path variable.  To edit your path, you want to change either .\/bash_profile or .\/bashrc &#8211; which I think are hidden files when you cd to ~.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Add package to path<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\ncd ~   # go to the root of everything\r\ngedit .bash_profile   # open up the bash profile with your text editor\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>If you do &#8220;ls&#8221; you won&#8217;t see it, I think because it starts with a &#8220;.&#8221;.  The basics of adding a folder to your path is appending it, and then exporting, like so:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\npath=$path:\/path\/to\/add\r\nexport path\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>and then save the .bash_profile, and you will have to log out and in again for the changes to happen.  If you don&#8217;t want to do that, you can also type those commands into the terminal window.<\/p>\n<p>And to provide closure to my particular problem, after eight hours of compiling from source for a gazillion and one libraries, attempting to edit source code on my own, and installing different compilers to see if it made a difference, I finally admitted defeat to getting this particular package installed.  However, that doesn&#8217;t take away from the utility of the commands that I detailed above, nor does it qualify the time spent as a waste.  I found this experience fun, and learned a very significant amount.  I am continually awed by the intricate design of software and machines, and excited as my brain continues to make sense of them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If an OS is like a religion, am I converted?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Am I converted?  Well, I don&#8217;t like the idea of joining an OS bootcamp and bashing the other side, because I don&#8217;t see why I can&#8217;t enjoy them all.   However, my love for the command line combined with my recent escapade of installing Ubuntu 11.04 on my Dad&#8217;s old laptop and seeing huge improvements in performance has me excited.  On some future date I would like to configure a system with something other than Windows, and not just do a dual boot or virtual machine.  I&#8217;m pretty excited about Chrome OS too, but I don&#8217;t think the browser alone is ready for the type of applications that I use on a daily basis.  Until then, it&#8217;s back to regedit, blue screens of death, using SSH to satisfy command line urges, constant searching for the right .dll, Windows Update, and Dell Diagnostics.

In retrospect, misleading geography could be blamed for what happened, however I probably should have undone the wrongness sooner than I actually did. It\u2019s amazing how I can keep track of so many useless details, but when it comes to connecting big concepts (like locations) I incorrectly connect A and B in the map in my head. Here is the story!\n\nOn Friday, July 2nd, I biked into the heart of Palo Alto to pay a visit to a sweet older woman that I had almost rented a room from. She told me her stories of traveling to Iraq, Europe, and South Africa, encouraged me to use the basement of the town hall as a resource for bike maps, and gave me hazelnut coffee brewed by her daughter somewhere in the hills of California. It was a different, and enjoyable experience, even though by the end my mind was drifting back to work. Mid afternoon I head out, and since I was already far from home, this somehow made it logical to go even farther to hit up the Safeway and obtain the rare, precious, jalapeno corn bread derivative that is the closest thing I can find to what used to be my life-staple back in North Carolina.\n\nSo I bike, I shop, and I leave the store. I am just starting on my way home, crossing a massive intersection, and all of a sudden I feel like I am biking on a deflated beach ball. I am forced to stop right in the line of fire of the row of hungry-to-zoom-zoom cars, get off my bike, feel the tire, and to my horror, it\u2019s completely flat. Crap. First I had to get out of the intersection, especially since I still had the oncoming traffic side to cross, and the little orange hand was already waving at me. I then realized that I was between 4 and 5 miles from home in high 80 degree weather with a poozied-out bike, a heavy bag of groceries, and a fully loaded backpack. So I walked it most of the way, and once I hit the far side of the Medical Campus was able to ride the Margaritte shuttle for the small distance home. It somehow made me very happy to see my little bike perched on the front of that massive bus \u2013 like an injured soldier loaded into the helicopter on his way to safety. I was also very grateful to the bus driver that helped me load and unload the bike from the bus. The entire trip on bike and foot calculated out to 18 miles, with 4 miles of walking with the bike. It was, simply put, a tiring day.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/mapofstupidity-300x193.png \"Map of Stupidity\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/mapofstupidity.png)\n\nOn Saturday I had a standard wake-up-early, do laundry and cleaning, get onto main campus, work until early afternoon, and then a nothing-out-of-the-ordinary walk to get dinner, and walk home. The entire process of starting off campus and finally arriving home is about two hours without a bike, but the time goes by quickly, and I don\u2019t mind the distance. But let\u2019s talk about Sunday.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have tried stopping at the bike shop on Saturday. It might have been open. By the time I thought about checking, it was Sunday, and assuredly closed until after the holiday on Tuesday. So I \u201cslept in\u201d again until 6:00am, and by 7:00am was working away in the LKSC, my favorite place in the world. I should also note that campus was completely deserted. It was lovely!\n\nMy work this weekend, however, has not been lovely. I\u2019ve been frustrated trying to figure out an inconsistency with an algorithm that has been used for meta analysis of fMRI\/sMRI data, as I want to use this same method in a project that I am working on. I won\u2019t get into the details, but basically I want to use this technique with data points from white matter in the brain, however the permutations that are done to create the null distribution for the probabilistic map are created with a gray matter mask. That means that any white matter coordinate would not be included, and consequently a white matter point in your data would be significantly different, by default. That is\u2026 a problem! But no one else seems to think so. This tool has been used in a handful of studies, specifically WITH white matter coordinates, so I am convinced that I must be missing something. Unfortunately, multiple readings of the methods papers and the studies that used the tool give me no insight. I then tried to figure out recreating the entire method from scratch in matlab, but I\u2019m a noob with statistics, and don\u2019t have extensive experience with different methods, and I couldn\u2019t figure it out. So I am frustrated. I am upset. I took a break from research and wrote a fun little matlab script to populate a mySQL database from an excel sheet (I\u2019m sure which I\u2019ll share at some future point) and then around noon I decided to call it a day, work wise. I typically go for about six hours on a weekend day before becomng aware of the time, but since I was troubled today, I cut it short a bit.\n\nI was hungry, and a little tired, so I decided that today might be the day to look into that one free delivery I could get from Safeway. I should note that I try to get ingredients and meals from the grocery store because it\u2019s much more affordable than anything you can get prepackaged on campus. As soon as I carefully put together my order and looked into the delivery options, I disappointingly saw that they closed for deliver for the holiday. However, by this point I had completely forgotten about the point of Safeway to begin with (convenience of delivery) and forged a plan to walk there. I got excited upon discovering a second store only 2.2 miles from the medical campus (South) and then another 2 or so to walk home, to the East. I left the frigidly air-conditioned LKSC, and stepped out into the dry heat. It was definitely in the 90\u2019s, and it felt completely wonderful. The campus was empty, so I stood in the middle of the Medical School stone plaza and spread out my arms to take in some sun for a good ten seconds. I then turned to the right, and started my walking.\n\nThe trip to the store was incredibly fast. I was very pleased. It was direct, and had I been on a bike, it would have been super easy. This could potentially be converted into a daily routine, which made me very happy, because I\u2019m always on the lookout for improvements in convenience, and more financially affordable options.\n\nAs I walked through the aisles I made decisions that I would later be very grateful for, namely decisions to not buy heavier items that were running low like cream rinse and a bottled drink. On the walk home the map in my head was very simple. I would retrace my steps down Sand Hill Road until I hit the first major intersection with a right turn, and that road would hit Junipero as a left turn, and that road would take me right home. I even had seen it once in a car, so I was convinced it would be easy. Oh, if I only knew what I was about to get into!\n\nTo get to the crux of the story, I found the right turn, and walked along a bike path directly off of the road toward my left turn onto Junipero. What I didn\u2019t see, what I couldn\u2019t see, was that when it snaked a little bit away from the road and sloped down into a valley, it actually crossed UNDERNEATH Junipero, and then came right back up on the other side. As a traveler on foot I was aware of crossing under what looked like a crossing for a train or small highway, but since it seemed disconnected from the road I was paralleling, it didn\u2019t even cross my mind that I was crossing under the road I needed to be on. It then promptly takes you right back up the road it was paralleling, and unless you are someone who frequently looks behind you, you mind not even have awareness that you crossed a left turn, period.\n\nNow you must be thinking \u2013 but wasn\u2019t I expecting a left turn with the name of Junipero? And here is the second fault of the geography. Right after you unknowingly cross under this road, you DO in fact hit an intersection with a left turn\u2026 AND there is a big sign that faces the left turn with the Junipero label on it. It isn\u2019t in the correct orientation for the road, which caught me off guard, and I actually stopped, started at it for a while, checked the GPS on my phone (which wasn\u2019t updated and showed me at the wrong location) and then I justified that it MUST be a variant street sign, and everything else fit right with my expectations for the turn, so it must be Junipero! So I happily turned left. This is when I proceeded to call my Dad and was completely taken up with something silly, explaining the xlsread function and datatypes in matlab. My phone proceeded to die, and I just kept walking. It\u2019s always been easy for me to walk, and I\u2019m not afraid of distance, but after an hour or so I started to wonder\u2026 how long does it take to walk two miles again? I saw\u2026 a brown fence, and rolling hills with grass, and it didn\u2019t look completely wrong, so I stubbornly continued. I finally started to have doubts, saw a lone runner along the roadside, and asked the dreaded question.\n\n> \u201cWhere does this road go?\u201d\n> \n> \u201cOh, somewhere up into the foothills.\u201d\n> \n> (crap!) \u201cWhich way is Stanford?\u201d\n> \n> \u201cOh, back the direction you are coming from. You want either Sand Hills, or I think there is another road called Junipero that will get you there as well.\u201d\n\nHe drew a map in the sand for me, and I realized that I was very much not where I expected to be.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/furrow.jpg \"furrowed look of frustration, and exhaustion.\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/furrow.jpg)\n\nI have just realized I\u2019m 2+ hours in the wrong direction, in close to 100 degree weather, and it\u2019s a long way home.\n\nThis is the moment in my journey when I realized that all of the distance I had just traveled would need to be retraced, and then the journey re-started. I thanked the runner, who walked with me about half a mile before I assured him I would be ok, and he could return to running. I kept bringing up the mental picture of the map in my head, over and over again. It WAS right. There were only these two main roads, and one left turn, and it was the first I would see, and I took it! Where did I go wrong? I felt silly and stupid for most of that walk back, and ruminated about how things might have been different had I not been so distracted, or just completely unaware of what the heck was going on. It wasn\u2019t until I returned to that intersection and saw it from the OTHER side that it occurred to me why I had so easily missed the turn.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1262\" style=\"width: 160px\">[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/10-150x150.jpg \"you can see the path turning off to the left, and how it snakes right under the left turn\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/10.jpeg)you can see the path turning off to the left, and how it snakes right under the left turn.\n\n<\/div><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1263\" style=\"width: 160px\">[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/11-150x150.jpg \"in order to actually turn left on this road, you can't get there via the small path, you have to walk on the highway\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/11.jpeg)in order to actually turn left on this road, you can't get there via the small path, you have to walk on the highway\n\n<\/div>I then proceeded to turn down the REAL Junipero, which ironically was only accessible by walking all the way back to the original intersection, and walking right on the busy road (instead of the bike path) to get to the left turn. As I was walking those last few miles, I thought about how this fits into the big picture of my daily life. It SHOULD serve as a lesson, or rationale, for me to either involve other people more in my life, so I would have more resources during times of trouble, or just have more social things planned, period, so the idea of walking for a big chunk of the afternoon wouldn\u2019t even be feasible. It SHOULD be a lesson for this, and I TRIED to really believe this, but in my mind, the entire situation served as a reinforcement of my ability to be independent and survive in the face of challenge. It also was a good indicator of my own stubbornness and incentive structure. I don\u2019t like spending money, and will go to great aims to minimize doing so. I probably could easily have found a local business off of the road somewhere, asked to use the phone, and called a cab. This, in my mind, wasn\u2019t an option. It also felt like a lazy person\u2019s solution. I was resolved to get myself out of this snaggle through the same means I had gotten into it \u2013 on my own two feet.\n\nWalking that last mile to home, I thought of the things I was grateful for.\n\n1. the lone man on road\n2. overcoming my stubbornness to talk to the lone man on the road\n3. going to the bathroom in the store\n4. deciding to not buy heavy items in the store\n5. that my feet didn\u2019t break on the walk (I thought about this possibility quite a bit\u2026 if there was any time that feet bones might spontaneously break, it would be during a trek like this)\n6. that my mind has a sense of humor. As I crossed the road to my driveway, I thought about what would happen to me in a slapstick movie. I\u2019d cross the street after eight years lost in the desert, mere steps from my door, and get plowed down by something moving fast. Haha. Ok, a little morbid, but it was a very funny thought, at the time!\n\nWhen I finally mapped it out, the entire journey was about 10.5 miles. In total, I went 6 miles in the wrong direction, and the extra distance translated into about 3-4 hours of extra walking in 100 degree weather. Yes, I can\u2019t believe it either, it\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s a good story and I wanted to share it, but I almost didn\u2019t want to admit that I was really this foolish.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/epicallystupid-copy-300x172.png \"Epic-ally stupid!\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/epicallystupid-copy.png)\n\nI don\u2019t sweat so much, but just LOOK at this. Unbelievable! My shirt arms and back were completely soaked, and I felt it trickling down my back.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/14-150x150.jpg \"Sweat from the front...\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/14.jpeg) [![](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/15-150x150.jpg \"Sweat from the back.\")](http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/15.jpeg)\n\nI had a yogurt in my bag, it smelled funny, and the dinner I had bought was squished and wilted. The good news, however, is that I feel fulfilled by this epic tiredness, and I\u2019m not so upset anymore about that silly algorithm. I\u2019ll fess up, my pre-frontal cortex was so tired of keeping a harness on all the frustration from earlier in the day, and I was so physically beat, that I did cry, just a little bit. But then I stepped into the wonderfulness of the shower, actually a COLD shower. It was as if my brain was clenched in a tight fist and when the water hit me, it shocked and quiverered a little, and then finally relaxed. I felt all the tension and stress metaphorically wash away.\n\n\n","html":"<p>This is the story of an unfortunate adventure, for which one day of bad luck slowly transitioned into another day of incredible bad luck.  In retrospect, misleading geography could be blamed for what happened, however I probably should have undone the wrongness sooner than I actually did.  It&#8217;s amazing how  I can keep track of so many useless details, but when it comes to connecting big concepts (like locations) I incorrectly connect A and B in the map in my head.  Here is the story!<\/p>\n<p>On Friday, July 2nd, I biked into the heart of Palo Alto to pay a visit to a sweet older woman that I had almost rented a room from.  She told me her stories of traveling to Iraq, Europe, and South Africa, encouraged me to use the basement of the town hall as a resource for bike maps, and gave me hazelnut coffee brewed by her daughter somewhere in the hills of California.  It was a different, and enjoyable experience, even though by the end my mind was drifting back to work.  Mid afternoon I head out, and since I was already far from home, this somehow made it logical to go even farther to hit up the Safeway and obtain the rare, precious, jalapeno corn bread derivative that is the closest thing I can find to what used to be my life-staple back in North Carolina.<\/p>\n<p>So I bike, I shop, and I leave the store.  I am just starting on my way home, crossing a massive intersection, and all of a sudden I feel like I am biking on a deflated beach ball.  I am forced to stop right in the line of fire of the row of hungry-to-zoom-zoom cars, get off my bike, feel the tire, and to my horror, it&#8217;s completely flat.  Crap.  First I had to get out of the intersection, especially since I still had the oncoming traffic side to cross, and the little orange hand was already waving at me.  I then realized that I was between 4 and 5 miles from home in high 80 degree weather with a poozied-out bike, a heavy bag of groceries, and a fully loaded backpack.  So I walked it most of the way, and once I hit the far side of the Medical Campus was able to ride the Margaritte shuttle for the small distance home.  It somehow made me very happy to see my little bike perched on the front of that massive bus &#8211; like an injured soldier loaded into the helicopter on his way to safety.  I was also very grateful to the bus driver that helped me load and unload the bike from the bus.  The entire trip on bike and foot calculated out to 18 miles, with 4 miles of walking with the bike.  It was, simply put, a tiring day.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/mapofstupidity.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1257\" title=\"Map of Stupidity\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/mapofstupidity-300x193.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On Saturday I had a standard wake-up-early, do laundry and cleaning, get onto main campus, work until early afternoon, and then a nothing-out-of-the-ordinary walk to get dinner, and walk home.  The entire process of starting off campus and finally arriving home is about two hours without a bike, but the time goes by quickly, and I don&#8217;t mind the distance.  But let&#8217;s talk about Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>In retrospect, I should have tried stopping at the bike shop on Saturday.  It might have been open.  By the time I thought about checking, it was Sunday, and assuredly closed until after the holiday on Tuesday.  So I &#8220;slept in&#8221; again until 6:00am, and by 7:00am was working away in the LKSC, my favorite place in the world.  I should also note that campus was completely deserted.  It was lovely!<\/p>\n<p>My work this weekend, however, has not been lovely.  I&#8217;ve been frustrated trying to figure out an inconsistency with an algorithm that has been used for meta analysis of fMRI\/sMRI data, as I want to use this same method in a project that I am working on.  I won&#8217;t get into the details, but basically I want to use this technique with data points from white matter in the brain, however the permutations that are done to create the null distribution for the probabilistic map are created with a gray matter mask.  That means that any white matter coordinate would not be included, and consequently a white matter point in your data would be significantly different, by default.  That is&#8230; a problem!  But no one else seems to think so.  This tool has been used in a handful of studies, specifically WITH white matter coordinates, so I am convinced that I must be missing something.  Unfortunately, multiple readings of the methods papers and the studies that used the tool give me no insight. I then tried to figure out recreating the entire method from scratch in matlab, but I&#8217;m a noob with statistics, and don&#8217;t have extensive experience with different methods, and I couldn&#8217;t figure it out.  So I am frustrated.  I am upset.  I took a break from research and wrote a fun little matlab script to populate a mySQL database from an excel sheet (I&#8217;m sure which I&#8217;ll share at some future point) and then around noon I decided to call it a day, work wise.  I typically go for about six hours on a weekend day before becomng aware of the time, but since I was troubled today, I cut it short a bit.<\/p>\n<p>I was hungry, and a little tired, so I decided that today might be the day to look into that one free delivery I could get from Safeway.  I should note that I try to get ingredients and meals from the grocery store because it&#8217;s much more affordable than anything you can get prepackaged on campus.  As soon as I carefully put together my order and looked into the delivery options, I disappointingly saw that they closed for deliver for the holiday.  However, by this point I had completely forgotten about the point of Safeway to begin with (convenience of delivery) and forged a plan to walk there.  I got excited upon discovering a second store only 2.2 miles from the medical campus (South) and then another 2 or so to walk home, to the East.  I left the frigidly air-conditioned LKSC, and stepped out into the dry heat.  It was definitely in the 90&#8217;s, and it felt completely wonderful.

Even in absence of most social activity outside of research and weekends devoted to work, the play is just not happening! Why is this problematic? It is problematic because I strongly believe that a researcher can be his or her greatest when only subjected to self-derived constraints. The most productive and interesting times of my young academic life have been when I find a cool method, and am independently driven to understand and extend it. That might include reading about statistical methods or mathematical principles that I do not understand, or diving into a tutorial to learn nuts and bolts. The idea is that the responsibility to explore is my own, and given that the catalyst is personal interest (and sometimes stubbornness), I would argue that this is the secret formula for creativity and productivity. I would hope that I was chosen to be a graduate student based on this intrinsic hunger for understanding, learning, and building things! This quality that emerges from the woodwork does not require an external hand of control. In fact, when you add this external control to the equation, the resulting sculpture is ruined. What might have emerged from the block is of an entirely different vision and hand. Thus, I want to argue that to best develop as a researcher, I must maintain control of my tools. I must have time to play.\n\nLet\u2019s start by breaking apart the composition of graduate school, which is me-as-a-researcher in the short term. The first two years are a whirlwind of trying to fulfill class and research rotation requirements, with the general idea that you should both be improving your computational prowess and finding your niche lab. There are a few courses that feel lovely in how I can see the relevancy, and a lot more courses that give me what unfortunately feels like busy work. Given my focused personality and desire for efficiency, when I feel that I am not learning or using my academic credits as wisely as I might, this is troubling. I will admit that I made the mistake of taking a handful of domain courses to supplement my research when I should have immediately jumped into strictly methods and computational ones. However, I would also argue that I was pushed into the domain knowledge courses due to the pressure to be able to propose marriage to a lab within a handful of rotations. How am I supposed to know if the domain is right for me if I have yet to explore it more deeply? All in all, the takeaway point here is that both of these components take up every ounce of my little graduate student soul, and leave no time for anything else.\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about me-as-a-researcher in the long term. The ultimate, and ideal goal is to identify a core problem that I am both interested in, AND good at. If I am good at something and not interested, that\u2019s like putting a cat in a room with a small dog. The cat could probably tear him apart, but he\u2019s thinking about a delicious mouse. If I am interested in something but not good at it, well then I could either become good at it or just be mediocre and happy, but then I wouldn\u2019t be able to really have an impact and it\u2019s probably not a good use of time assuming that the ideal algorithm is to match people with what they are best at. Ideally, I would want to be able to have at least a sense of this particular problem that I want to pursue by the end of two years, giving me approximately 3 to 4 years to pursue that and nothing else! The \u201cend\u201d of the journey is a beautiful and passionate dissertation to earn a PhD, and then stepping into a new set of academic shoes. For now, we will stay within this journey of obtaining the PhD. I would now like to explain why I need time to play in these first two years, a dynamic that is not supported by the current structure.\n\nIn middle-school, high-school, and college, the world was very narrow. There was a small set of well defined problems, handed to me by the teacher, and I could prove mastery by solving them and getting the best grade in the class. Never did I have to think about problems in the \u201creal world\u201d and I certainly didn\u2019t have to define my own problems and independent plans of action for pursuing them. This flipped dynamic is of course definitive of graduate school! For the first time I am seeing so many interesting problems, and so many various sub-problems (even under the same domain umbrella)\u2026 which one to choose? I know that I am smart and capable, and making this choice is a matter of:\n\n1. identifying said core problem\n2. hammering down resources for learning, and allocating time to make sure I have the breadth and depth to have domain mastery\n3. pursuing a specific question with this mastery\n\nand at some point hovering around steps 2 and 3 I might transition into a \u201creal\u201d researcher. This train of thought is why I do not believe that it make sense to publish in the first, second, or X year of graduate school. How can one so quickly identify, understand, and conduct meaningful research about any particular domain? I know that the rule of the road is publish or perish, but I most certainly don\u2019t want to publish for the sake of publishing. Just having a result does not mean it is worthy of telling the rest of the world. I am sure that many young graduate students pursue guided work that is meaningful and should be published, however largely I think that meaningful contributions are more likely to take half a decade of work\u2026 or a large nugget of a lifetime! A large percentage of papers that do get published by dewy, green graduate students probably are not that great. However, I digress! This process of identifying and being ready to pursue a problem should be the goal after two years.\n\nThe pressure of the short term goals (paragraph 2) is what endangers this process. It is very likely that one can be so overwhelmed with other things that they are unable to choose at all, or choose the wrong domain or question due to not having enough time or mental energy to explore. Let\u2019s go back to talking about my little busy-graduate-student brain. It is latched on again to the high-school and college mindset of cranking out problem sets, preparing for exams, and trying to meet expectations of advisors and professors because I am being stamped with grades and forms with long lists of requirements. It should not matter, and even when I intellectually acknowledge this dynamic, I cannot get around the fact that learning is a different experience when I feel it is forced as opposed to being my own exploration and choice. When I learn something fantastic, and a little light goes off in my head of something I am eager to play around with, I always find myself asking \u201cso when can I get to try that out?\u201d The answer is usually some convoluted \u201cat some time in the future.\u201d I then add it to the place where ideas go to die, a list of things in a Google Doc that are delayed indefinitely because I have to prioritize everything else. The irony is that the exploration of these little ideas, being allowed to play, would better lead me to identify my focus, and lead to more productive work.\n\nIf we were real scientists or researchers, we would be driven by those little impulses to play with ideas. I would feel a spark, and perhaps work for a week on Idea 1, go for a month on Idea 2, identify a gap in my knowledge and spend time just reading, and focus the courses that I take based on these gaps. I would hungrily run around to every lecture that I find interesting, and be given the freedom and trust of using my time in a way that will lead to the two year goal of identifying a domain and problem. There would not be expectation of sitting in any particular chair for X hours a day to fulfill some confusing requirement, or taking a course of flavor Y because someone else is convinced I will be incomplete without it. This level of control, namely how every quarter I have to take an overloaded number of courses (no matter what!) and do X,Y,Z in a rotation (no matter what!) is suffocating and stifling. I largely do not have a choice. If I do not sign my name on the line and get everything done, I won\u2019t fulfill requirements by the end of two years and can chance losing funding, which is the equivalent of death for the graduate student. The problem is that during these two years we aren\u2019t allowed to be real scientists, yet after two years it is what will be expected of us. We aren\u2019t allowed to follow impulse and passion and idea because there just isn\u2019t time, and by the time we are given time (after courses are over) we have already proposed marriage to a domain \/ lab that may not have been the choice had we time to explore. The carving might turn into a dancing penguin when it would have been a contemplative giraffe.\n\nSo, this is the fundamental problem in my head. I feel an urgency and a drive to find \u201cthat problem\u201d that I think I could both be good at AND make a difference. But that is in conflict with what I think I should be doing now, which is learning how to ask better questions and developing a computational background that is going to give me the ability to answer those questions. To have a program structured that forces the student to do both at the same time does in fact the exact opposite, because there is no time to play. Neither domain or intellectual depth is reached. And this problem is not limited to any particular institution. I love my school. I know that I am in the right program, and am blessed to have more freedom than the average graduate student. However, I yearn for less control and more freedom to run around taking in as much knowledge goodness I can be present for, pursuing projects with fellow graduate students driven by intellectual curiosity, and growing as a real researcher as opposed to an individual trying to fulfill what others expect of her. This is why I want to play, and even if I cannot, I will stand on this little soap-box and declare it to the world. I will continue to plow up this hill with hopes that after two years, the environment that I might find at the top is the same place I would have decided to want for myself.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I don&#8217;t have enough time to play.

To have a program structured that forces the student to do both at the same time does in fact the exact opposite, because there is no time to play. Neither domain or intellectual depth is reached. And this problem is not limited to any particular institution. I love my school. I know that I am in the right program, and am blessed to have more freedom than the average graduate student. However, I yearn for less control and more freedom to run around taking in as much knowledge goodness I can be present for, pursuing projects with fellow graduate students driven by intellectual curiosity, and growing as a real researcher as opposed to an individual trying to fulfill what others expect of her. This is why I want to play, and even if I cannot, I will stand on this little soap-box and declare it to the world. I will continue to plow up this hill with hopes that after two years, the environment that I might find at the top is the same place I would have decided to want for myself.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sun, 19 Feb 2012 17:38:52 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 21:09:08 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 19 Feb 2012 17:38:52 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1312,"title":"The Lorax","slug":"the-lone-lorax","markdown":"\nwhen drips a little puddle  \n escaped from cocoa spoon  \n he sees inside the muddle  \n the lorax in his room  \n behind the wall a pip  \n and dance a veiny maze  \n this reflection that he sips  \n this awkward, curly gaze  \n a laugh so shrill,  \n a voice so near  \n a tummy far away  \n a love to nill  \n a sense of fear  \n a heart that does dismay  \n dry up the puddle might  \n and he will wipe away  \n his hopes and dainty fright  \n for maybe one more day  \n for deep down he knows  \n that lorax come undone  \n for deep conviction he goes  \n the safest route as one\n\n\n","html":"<p>when drips a little puddle<br \/>\nescaped from cocoa spoon<br \/>\nhe sees inside the muddle<br \/>\nthe lorax in his room<br \/>\nbehind the wall a pip<br \/>\nand dance a veiny maze<br \/>\nthis reflection that he sips<br \/>\nthis awkward, curly gaze<br \/>\na laugh so shrill,<br \/>\na voice so near<br \/>\na tummy far away<br \/>\na love to nill<br \/>\na sense of fear<br \/>\na heart that does dismay<br \/>\ndry up the puddle might<br \/>\nand he will wipe away<br \/>\nhis hopes and dainty fright<br \/>\nfor maybe one more day<br \/>\nfor deep down he knows<br \/>\nthat lorax come undone<br \/>\nfor deep conviction he goes<br \/>\nthe safest route  as one<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Mon, 05 Mar 2012 01:20:26 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 22:02:06 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 05 Mar 2012 01:20:26 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1319,"title":"MATLAB libc.so.6 not found error Fix","slug":"matlab-libc-so-6-not-found-error-fix","markdown":"\nFor as long as I\u2019ve had linux, my MATLAB spits out the following \u201cnot found\u201d error on startup:\n\ncode\n\nHowever it is clear that I have the library:\n\ncode\n\nThe answer is to create a symbolic link from this library to your machine\u2019s standard lib folder, as follows:\n\ncode\n\n\u2026and you will never see the not found error again!\n\n\n","html":"<p>For as long as I&#8217;ve had linux, my MATLAB spits out the following &#8220;not found&#8221; error on startup:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \n\n...\/matlab\/bin\/util\/oscheck.sh: 605: \/lib\/libc.so.6: not found\n\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>However it is clear that I have the library:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \n\n$ locate libc.so.6\n\n\/lib\/i386-linux-gnu\/libc.so.6\n\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>The answer is to create a symbolic link from this library to your machine&#8217;s standard lib folder, as follows:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \n\n$ ln -s \/lib\/i386-linux-gnu\/libc.so.6 \/lib\/libc.so.6\n\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>&#8230;and you will never see the not found error again!<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sun, 25 Mar 2012 10:51:42 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 21:09:08 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 25 Mar 2012 10:51:42 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1353,"title":"Brain Message 1.0 to Write Secret Messages into fMRI","slug":"brain-message","markdown":"\nHave you ever seen interesting shapes emerge as components when running independent component analysis (ICA) on resting BOLD functional MRI (fMRI) data?

Keep following the instructions to run gcloud auth login. The command line will then ask you to enter a Project ID, so I entered my Project ID from step 1.\n\n**3)** I then enabled billing for my project, which can be done under the \u201cSettings\u201d tab. I then clicked on \u201cCompute Engine\u201d to get it started, and then returned to the command line to create an instance. (Note that I am skipping the step to \u201cadd a firewall\u201d because I\u2019m not concerned with making anything available on the web.)\n\ncode\n\nNote \u2013 if it tells you there is an upgrade and you upgrade by doing \u201cgcloud components update,\u201d you will need to re-authorize your account with google SDK before doing the addinstance command above.\n\ncode\n\nThe first time I did this, I chose a small and cheap image. Since this is an image I\u2019d like to do analysis with, I\u2019m going to try and choose one (somewhat) like the one suggested on Amazon EC2:\n\n- Instance Family: Compute Optimized\n- Instance Type: c3.4xlarge\n- Arch: 64-bit\n- vPCU: 16\n- ECU: 55\n- Memory: 30 GB\n- Storage: 2 x 160 SSD\n- EBS-Optimized: Yes\n- Available Network Performance: High\n\nThe complete list of prices are [here](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/products\/compute-engine\/). I chose n1-highmem-8.\n\ncode\n\nCosmos on AWS was on an Ubuntu image (I think), so the first time that I did this, I choose Debian Wheezy. It will ask you to set up an ssh key, and enter a password. Don\u2019t forget it ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)\n\nThe second time around, since I had saved my previous image, I was able to load it! If you have an image saved on Google Cloud, you will see it in the list, eg:\n\ncode\n\nI should note that I selected a more powerful machine to deploy an image that was created on a much dinkier one. It seemed to work! This is a lesson that if you just want to setup infrastructure (and no analysis) it\u2019s ok to choose the cheaper option. When you finish, you\u2019ll see something like this:\n\ncode\n\n**4)** Cosmos has a web interface (I think) so I also [set up a firewall](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/compute\/docs\/networking#addingafirewall) to access the instance from my IP address. I used gcutil again:\n\ncode\n\nNow that the billing clock is started, let\u2019s log in:\n\ncode\n\nIf you are installing a new cosmos instance, see below. To continue on the cosmos-test instance that I created, skip this section.\n\n\n## Cosmos Installation\n\nI first checked the version of python, and it is indeed 2.7.3. I now am following the instructions on the [cosmos wiki](http:\/\/ec2-107-22-176-16.compute-1.amazonaws.com\/docs\/Cosmos\/install.html). I proceeded to update all packages, and install required packages:\n\ncode\n\nAll the installations worked without error. For mysql-server it will ask you to set root\u2019s password. I then moved forward with installing pip, which we need for virtualenv:\n\ncode\n\nI want to point out that installing pkg-config is extremely important! \u00a0It\u2019s not obvious unless you spend lots of time reading error logs that installing this package eliminates enormous amounts of installation errors. Lynx is also important for peeking at the cosmos web browser from the terminal window.\n\ncode\n\nNote \u2013 we are installing sqlite3 for a local database solution \u2013 trying out the simplest option.\n\ncode\n\nI then added this to .bash_aliases\n\ncode\n\n(and reminder, to stop, do \u201cdeactivate cosmos\u201d)\n\ncode\n\nI got an error about graphviz, because my setup had trouble finding graphviz, so I had to edit the setup.py file to include the paths:\n\ncode\n\nUncomment the lines for the library_path and include_path, of course making sure that they are correct!\n\nthen I did this again:\n\ncode\n\nNow, we need to create a sqlite3 database for cosmos to use. Go to your home directory, and make a db directory:\n\ncode\n\nSpecifically, go to to databases, and add the path to your cosmos.db\n\ncode\n\nNow that our database is setup, and since this is a django installation, we should use cosmos and run \u201csyncdb,\u201d and collect static files.\n\ncode\n\nA successful run will show all of the application tables being created. Lastly, we need to create the cosmos_out folder, and change permissions:\n\ncode\n\n\n## Installation of GenomeKey, etc.\n\nNow that we have cosmos up and running, let\u2019s install GenomeKey and the bucketload of software it uses, which cosmos will use (I think) to perform analyses:\n\ncode\n\nIf we now look at the wga_settings.py file, we can see that it needs to be updated for running on Google Cloud:\n\ncode\n\nIt looks like I can\u2019t fork the repository, so I\u2019ll log here the changes that I make to the code. This script reads the cosmos.ini file to figure out configuation settings, so let\u2019s first tweak that to include Google Cloud:\n\ncode\n\nI changed the \u201cdefault_server\u201d to \u201cgoogle_cloud\u201d:\n\ncode\n\nAnd then I added this option to the wga_settings.py\n\ncode\n\nThen obviously we need to install WGA there! Let\u2019s do that now. I followed my own instructions [here](http:\/\/www.vbmis.com\/learn\/introduction-to-the-genome-analysis-toolkit-gatk-i\/ ). \u00a0I\u2019ll repeat the steps here. First, install java. We must have 1.7:\n\ncode\n\nNow download and test GATK. I had to download from their GUI and upload to my server \u2013 so this is the version as of 1\/19\/2014.\n\ncode\n\nLet\u2019s also install the Picard tools and the Burrows Wheeler Aligner, and everything else in the ginormous list in wga_settings.py:\n\ncode\n\nWe now need to run it for the first time to edit the configuration file. Still from within the Annovar Extensions directory\u2026\n\ncode\n\nListen to what it says! Here is how I edited the configuration file:\n\ncode\n\nThen when you try \u201cannovarext listdb\u201d again, you will see a long list of databases. Now let\u2019s return to the Packages\/tools folder and download the rest.\n\ncode\n\nYou can either put it where it expects it (as instructed above), or see line 52 of the MakeFile and change the path to where you installed it. Now let\u2019s add the GATK, Picard tools, and Burrows Wheel Aligned to your path. This is probably unnecessary if the wga_settings.py has all these paths, but it doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\ncode\n\nNow we should go back to the wga settings and update the paths for our added software. I\u2019m not going to post this yet because I still need confirmation for some of the above.\n\ncode\n\n\n## Testing Genome Key\n\nFirst check that we are calling genome key from our virtual environment. This is a little confusing because the Genome Key documentation says to call it from the bin directory under the folder in Packages, but we should be calling the one installed to our virtualenv:\n\ncode\n\nThis is where I ran into trouble \u2013 it hangs on loading the config.ini file, and then pressing enter, there is a cascade of errors about not being able to find my data directory. This seems to be an issue with the Annovar Extensions and not genomekey. After [much troubleshooting](http:\/\/www.vbmis.com\/bmi\/share\/wall\/genomeKey_error.txt), the workaround I found is to edit the data directory path, commenting out the old line, and adding the new one:\n\ncode\n\nThen everything works! Now let\u2019s run a test job. First we need to update the paths for the bam files:\n\ncode\n\nand run the job:\n\ncode\n\nThis is where I got a huge error stream about failed job attempts, because clearly this software expects some kind of job manager. I\u2019m currently reading about this and figuring it out. We need a job manager!\n\n\n## Mounting Resource Bundle\n\nWe now have the issue of the resource bundle, which does not yet have a \u201ccloud solution.\u201d It would be ideal for them to host this in the cloud, and we just connect to it over making our own copy, but since we need some of the files, I figured out which ones by reading the wga_settings file, and downloaded to my local machine with FTP:\n\ncode\n\nWhen I first tried to download these to the instance directly, I ran into trouble doing this \u2013 ran out of room! Instead, I created a google cloud folder, \/stanford-genomes\/resources\/bundle\/current to send these files to. I assumed that it would be easy to mount a google cloud folder, but I still haven\u2019t figured out how to map it. There are [unreliable solutions](https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/s3fuse\/) and the most I can find is ability to connect and download \/ read, but [it\u2019s not a mount](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/compute\/docs\/authentication#applications).\n\nHere is my proposed solution (and I would like feedback on this). I can [create an external disk](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/compute\/docs\/transition-v1), and then [save this disk to a snapshot](http:\/\/googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com\/2013\/10\/persistent-disk-backups-using-snapshots.html). I don\u2019t think that the mounted disk should be saved in the image, but rather mounted with a new instance. I also checked that multiple images can mount, and the data is read only. For now, I\u2019ll send them to our Google Cloud Storage.\n\nFirst let\u2019s create a persistent disk. The files are just under 25GB, but I read that creating a disk less than 200GB creates problems, so let\u2019s do 200GB. We also need to be under the same zone as the instance:\n\ncode\n\n\n## Saving an Image\n\nWhen we finish working and want to save an image (for next time)\n\ncode\n\nThen we need to upload it to Google Cloud Storage\n\ncode\n\nThe next time that you use gsutil to add an instance, you will see your image as an option\n\n\n## Loading an Image\n\nIf the instance is running, then you can connect to it via:\n\ncode\n\nIf not, see the instructions under [Creating a New Instance](#one), and be sure to select \u201ccosmos-instance\u201d as the image for your instance. Then do the command above. Once you ssh in, we first need to jump back into our virtual environment:\n\ncode\n\nNow I am following the instructions [here](http:\/\/ec2-107-22-176-16.compute-1.amazonaws.com\/docs\/Cosmos\/getting_started.html).\n\ncode\n\nWe can then use lynx to view the cosmos web gui:\n\ncode\n\n\n## **Log of Instances**\n\nCurrently existing instances are genomekey-test-5, genomekey-test-6, to be used to create a shared file system and then a job manager. I will save images for both a master and slave nodes, and create documentation for use.\n\nI will delete unnecessary images when I have everything working, and an image finalized.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Google Compute Engine is the equivalent of Amazon&#8217;s EC2.

After <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vbmis.com\/bmi\/share\/wall\/genomeKey_error.txt\" target=\"_blank\">much troubleshooting<\/a>, the workaround I found is to edit the data directory path, commenting out the old line, and adding the new one:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nvim \/home\/vanessa\/packages\/wga\/tools\/annovarextensions\/annovarext\/config.py\r\n#data_dir = os.environ.get('annovarext_data',opj(user_home_path,'.annovarext\/'))\r\ndata_dir = opj(user_home_path,'.annovarext\/')\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>Then everything works!  Now let&#8217;s run a test job.  First we need to update the paths for the bam files:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nvim \/home\/vanessa\/packages\/genomekey\/test\/test_bams.list\r\n\/home\/vanessa\/packages\/genomekey\/test\/bgi\/111582.test.bam\r\n\/home\/vanessa\/packages\/genomekey\/test\/bgi\/120099.test.bam\r\n\/home\/vanessa\/packages\/genomekey\/test\/bgi\/125731.test.bam\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>and run the job:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\ngenomekey -test bam -n 'test gk' -il \/home\/vanessa\/packages\/genomekey\/test\/test_bams.list \r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>This is where I got a huge error stream about failed job attempts, because clearly this software expects some kind of job manager.

We need a job manager!<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"mnt\">Mounting Resource Bundle<\/h2>\n<p>We now have the issue of the resource bundle, which does not yet have a &#8220;cloud solution.&#8221; It would be ideal for them to host this in the cloud, and we just connect to it over making our own copy, but since we need some of the files, I figured out which ones by reading the wga_settings file, and downloaded to my local machine with FTP:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nwget ftp:\/&#47;&#x67;&#x73;ap&#117;&#x62;&#x66;tp&#45;&#x61;&#x6e;on&#x79;&#x6d;&#x6f;u&#115;&#x40;&#x66;tp&#46;&#x62;&#x72;oa&#100;&#x69;&#x6e;st&#x69;&#x74;&#x75;t&#101;&#x2e;&#x6f;rg\/bundle\/2.8\/b37\/mills_and_1000g_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf.gz\r\nwget ftp:&#47;&#x2f;&#103;&#x73;&#97;&#x70;&#117;&#x62;&#102;&#x74;&#112;&#x2d;&#97;&#x6e;&#111;&#x6e;&#121;&#x6d;&#111;&#x75;&#115;&#x40;&#102;&#x74;&#112;&#x2e;&#98;&#x72;&#111;&#x61;&#100;&#x69;&#110;&#x73;&#116;&#x69;&#116;&#x75;&#116;&#x65;&#46;&#x6f;&#114;&#x67;\/bundle\/2.8\/b37\/1000g_phase1.snps.high_confidence.b37.vcf.gz\r\nwget ftp:&#47;&#x2f;&#103;&#x73;&#97;&#x70;&#117;&#x62;&#102;&#x74;p&#x2d;a&#x6e;o&#x6e;y&#x6d;o&#x75;s&#x40;f&#x74;p&#x2e;b&#x72;o&#x61;d&#x69;n&#x73;t&#x69;t&#x75;t&#x65;.&#x6f;r&#x67;\/bundle\/2.8\/b37\/dbsnp_138.b37.vcf.gz\r\nwget ftp:&#x2f;&#x2f;&#x67;&#x73;&#x61;&#x70;&#x75;&#98;&#102;&#116;p-anon&#x79;&#x6d;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x73;&#x40;&#x66;&#x74;&#112;&#46;broadin&#x73;&#x74;&#x69;&#x74;&#x75;&#x74;&#x65;&#46;&#111;&#114;g\/bundle\/2.8\/b37\/human_g1k_v37.fasta.gz\r\nwget ftp:\/&#x2f;g&#115;&#x61;p&#x75;b&#102;&#x74;p&#x2d;&#x61;n&#x6f;n&#121;&#x6d;o&#x75;&#x73;&#64;&#x66;t&#112;&#x2e;b&#x72;o&#97;&#x64;i&#110;&#x73;t&#x69;t&#117;&#x74;e&#x2e;&#x6f;r&#x67;\/bundle\/2.8\/b37\/hapmap_3.3.b37.vcf.gz\r\nwget ftp:&#x2f;&#x2f;&#103;sap&#x75;&#x62;&#x66;&#116;p-&#x61;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#110;ym&#x6f;&#x75;&#x73;&#64;ft&#x70;&#x2e;&#x62;&#114;oad&#x69;&#x6e;&#x73;&#116;it&#x75;&#x74;&#x65;&#46;or&#x67;\/bundle\/2.8\/b37\/1000g_omni2.5.b37.vcf.gz\r\ngunzip *.gz\r\nwget ftp:\/\/&#x67;&#x73;&#x61;pu&#98;&#x66;&#x74;p-&#97;&#x6e;&#x6f;ny&#109;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x73;&#64;f&#x74;&#x70;&#x2e;br&#111;&#x61;&#x64;in&#115;&#x74;&#x69;tu&#116;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x6f;rg\/bundle\/2.8\/b37\/1000g_phase1.indels.b37.vcf.gz\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>When I first tried to download these to the instance directly, I ran into trouble doing this &#8211; ran out of room!

There are <a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/s3fuse\/\" target=\"_blank\">unreliable solutions<\/a> and the most I can find is ability to connect and download \/ read, but <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/compute\/docs\/authentication#applications\" target=\"_blank\">it&#8217;s not a mount<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here is my proposed solution (and I would like feedback on this).

We also have different theories for how we think about the relationship between genes and disease. The **common variant model** of disease says that there are a bunch of variations in our genetic code that are pretty common, and it\u2019s when you get a particular combination of these common\u00a0variants that you develop disease. \u00a0The **rare variant model** says that disease can be accounted for by a much smaller number of rare variants (perhaps that are only present in an individual or family.) \u00a0I\u2019m not going to state\u00a0that one is more right than the other, however my opinion is that the rare variant model makes more sense in the context of diseases like autism for which we still haven\u2019t found a \u201cgenetic signature\u201d in the most typical places to look. \u00a0Where are those places? We typically look at protein coding sequences of the genome (called the \u201cexome\u201d), across a bunch of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [[snpedia](http:\/\/www.snpedia.com\/index.php\/SNPedia)]. \u00a0What are we looking at, exactly?\n\nWhen we look at someones genetic code, you may remember that genes are made of the base pairs ATCG, called nucleotides. And you may also know that while we are all very similar in this sequence, there are random insertions, deletions, or other kinds of variation that happens. Is this good or bad? Well, a lot of the mutations don\u2019t really do anything that is totally obvious to us. However, sometimes if a mutation changes the function of a gene (meaning that a protein is not coded, or is coded differently), this could lead to phenotypic changes (some of which might be linked to the disease!) So when we want to study diseases (and possible find explanations for them), we are interested in finding these mutations. \u00a0So in a nutshell, \u201cvariant analysis\u201d is looking at variations in our genetic sequence, and hoping to link those variations to disease.\n\n\n# What is a vcf file?\n\nIn biomedical informatics we are very good at making standard file formats. A vcf file is just a formatted text file in \u201c[variant call format](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Variant_Call_Format),\u201d meaning that it is full of information about variants! \u00a0And here we are at this post. \u00a0I need to learn how to parse a vcf file to find rare variants. First let\u00a0me\u00a0(broadly) set up the analysis that I\u00a0want to do:\n\n1. Define a threshold of \u201crare\u201d to be represented in <1% of the population\n2. Extract these rare variants\n3. Filter down the set to only include deleterious or important\n4. Map these variants to genes\n5. Add in some (intelligent?) weighting, (to be thought about later)\n6. DAVID (more on this later)\n\nThe first step is to get a vcf file. I am using one from our autism dataset.\n\nNext, we should decide how to work with this file. It is again notable that the file is just a text file \u2013 there is nothing magic or compiled about it ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png) This means that if we wanted, we could write our own script with bash, python, R, etc. However, there are already tools that are made for this! Let\u2019s download (and learn) the\u00a0[vcftools](http:\/\/vcftools.sourceforge.net\/downloads.html)\u00a0and a nice little package for working with big text tables called [tabix](http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/samtools\/files\/tabix\/).\n\nFirst, get the vcftools with subversion:\n\ncode\n\nNote this means you can always then cd to your vcftools directory and type \u201csvn update\u201d to do exactly that. Once we have the tools, we need to compile for perl. CD to where you installed them:\n\ncode\n\n# Export the path to the perl subdirectory:  \n export PERL5LIB=\/home\/vanessa\/Packages\/vcftools\/perl\/\n\n# and (in the vcftools directory), compile!  \n make  \n [\/code]  \n Now for tabix, download and extract\/unzip to your Packages folder\n\ncode\n\nNow we need to add the tools to our path:\n\ncode\n\nNow source the bash profile to adjust the path\n\ncode\n\nand now when you type \u201cwhich vcftools\u201d you should see:\n\ncode\n\nGood job!\n\n\n# Why do we have vcf files?\n\nAgain, the variant call format (vcf) is a text file for storing gene sequence variations. Why did someone come up with it? Well, if we stored an ENTIRE genome, that is a MASSIVE file. Someone smart a while back figured out that we could store a \u201cstandard human genome\u201d (we call this a reference), and then a second file (the vcf) that describes how one or more people vary from this reference. It starts with lots of header fields for meta information, and then is basically rows and rows of variants, each of which has meta information of its own! Let\u2019s take a look at what this might look like. I\u2019m going to steal this right off of wikipedia:\n\nThe junk at the top with ## before it are all meta (header) information fields. For example, if you were opening this file for the first time, you might want to know how it was filtered, and what different annotations in the file mean (e.g., AA == Ancestral Allele\u201d).\n\nWhen the double ## goes down to a single #, these are the field names that describe the following rows, including:\n\n- CHROM: Chromosome number\n- POS: Position on the chromosome\n- ID: If (for example) a SNP has a particular ID (rs*)\n- REF: This is the base that is found in the reference genome\n- ALT: This is the alternate allele found in the sample\u2019s genome\n- QUAL: This is a quality score, called a \u201cPhred quality score\u201d http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phred_quality_score, 10log_10 prob(call in ALT is wrong).\n- FILTER: If the nucleotide passes all filters, it will say PASS. if it says something else, this is the filter that was not passed\n- INFO: NS means \u201cnumber of samples\u201d and you should look up the link provided below to see what all the other acronyms mean!\n- FORMAT: the stuff here explains what the numbers mean in the next set of columns (the samples). For example,\n- GT:GQ:DP:HQ says that the first thing is a genotype, followed by a conditional genotype quality, a read depth, and haplotype qualities. For the genotype, the | means phased and \/ means unphased.\n\n ##info=<id depth=\"\"> ##info=<id frequency=\"\"> ##info=<id allele=\"\"> ##info=<id build=\"\" membership=\"\"> ##info=<id membership=\"\"> ##filter=<id below=\"\"> ##filter=<id data=\"\" have=\"\" of=\"\" samples=\"\" than=\"\"> ##format=<id quality=\"\"> ##format=<id> ##format=<id depth=\"\"> ##format=<id quality=\"\"> #chrom pos id ref alt qual filter info format sample1 sample2 sample3 2 4370 rs6057 g a 29 . ns=2;dp=13;af=0.5;db;h2 gt:gq:dp:hq 0|0:48:1:52,51 1|0:48:8:51,51 1\/1:43:5:.,. 2 7330 . t a 3 q10 ns=5;dp=12;af=0.017 gt:gq:dp:hq 0|0:46:3:58,50 0|1:3:5:65,3 0\/0:41:3 2 110696 rs6055 a g,t 67 pass ns=2;dp=10;af=0.333,0.667;aa=t;db gt:gq:dp:hq 1|2:21:6:23,27 2|1:2:0:18,2 2\/2:35:4 2 130237 . t . 47 . ns=2;dp=16;aa=t gt:gq:dp:hq 0|0:54:7:56,60 0|0:48:4:56,51 0\/0:61:2 2 134567 microsat1 gtct g,gtact 50 pass ns=2;dp=9;aa=g gt:gq:dp 0\/1:35:4 0\/2:17:2 1\/1:40:3 \">code<\/id><\/id><\/id><\/id><\/id><\/id><\/id><\/id><\/id><\/id><\/id>\n\nThis is why you should not be afraid when someone mentions a vcf file. It\u2019s just a text file that follows a particular format. I went over the basics, but if you want more details on the format can be [found here](http:\/\/www.1000genomes.org\/wiki\/Analysis\/Variant%2520Call%2520Format\/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41).\n\n\n# Basic working with vcf files\n\nWe will first get comfortable working with the tools, and then write a bash (or python) script to achieve the functionality that we want. Let\u2019s cd to where we downloaded the vcf file:\n\ncode\n\nLet\u2019s get basic info about our vcf file:\n\ncode\n\n\n# Filtering and Writing Files\n\nWe might want to filter down to a certain chromosome, a quality score, or just for a particular region. This is super easy to do!\n\ncode\n\nI\u2019m not sure how you would a priori decide which bases to look at. Perhaps doing a search for a gene, and then deciding in this interface?\n\nBut the entire purpose of filtering is to reduce your data to some subset, so arguably we would want to write this subset to a new file. To do this, just add \u201c\u2013recode \u2013recode-INFO-all\u201d. The second part makes sure that we keep the metadata.\n\ncode\n\nYou can also pipe the output into a file, sort of like the above\n\ncode\n\nTwo files are produced: a subset.log (containing the screen output you would have seen) and a subset.recode.vcf with the filtered data. If you want to pipe the data into your script (and not produce a gazillion new files) you can also do that pretty easily:\n\ncode\n\nIf you want to look through it manually, add | more like this:\n\ncode\n\nOr the equivalent | less will let you browse through it in a terminal like vim (and scroll up, etc.)\n\n\n# Comparing Files\n\nIf I had a Mom and a Dad and child, or any people that I want to compare, I can do that too!\n\ncode\n\nYou could again pipe that into an output file.\n\n\n# Getting Allele Frequencies\n\nYou can also get allele frequency for ALL people in your file like this:\n\ncode\n\nCHROM POS N_ALLELES N_CHR {ALLELE:FREQ}  \n 1 69511 2 2 A:0 G:1  \n 1 881627 2 2 G:0.5 A:0.5  \n 1 887801 2 2 A:0 G:1  \n 1 888639 2 2 T:0 C:1  \n 1 888659 2 2 T:0 C:1  \n 1 897325 2 2 G:0 C:1  \n 1 900505 2 2 G:0.5 C:0.5  \n 1 909238 2 2 G:0 C:1  \n 1 909309 2 2 T:0.5 C:0.5  \n 1 949608 2 2 G:0.5 A:0.5  \n \u2026\n\nI can imagine wanting to do this with MANY vcf files to get averages for a particular population. The above isn\u2019t very interesting because I only have ONE person, so it\u2019s essentially showing that for a particular chromosome, a particular position, there are 2 possible alleles at a given locus (N_ALLELES), the alternate and the reference, and we have data available for both of those at each site (N_CHR), the reference and our sample. Then the last two columns show the frequency counts for each. Let\u2019s download another set of VCFs and see if we can merge them! I think the perl vcftools could accomplish this.\n\n\n# Merging many VCF files into one\n\nIt looks like we are going to need to compress the files (using bgzip) and index (using tabix) before doing any kind of combination. Note that doing bgzip *.vcf is not going to work, so we need to feed in a list of files. Here is how to do that.\n\ncode\n\nThere they are! If you try to look at the file, it\u2019s compiled (hence the efficient indexing) so it looks like gobbeltee-gook.\n\n\n# Merging the files into one VCF!\n\ncode\n\nSweet! That seemed to work. We are making progress in the world! Now let\u2019s try calculating the allele frequencies (for a more interesting result?)\n\ncode\n\nRight off the bat we can see that there are markers that we only have for a subset of the population (the ones that are not 12 \u2013 since we have 6 people if everyone has two, this means that the N_CHR would be 12?). I think more importantly in this file is the Allele Frequency \u2013 for example having A for 949654 is super rare! Again, this is calculating frequencies across our vcf files. I think if we are looking for variants in autism, for example, we would want to compare to a reference genome, because it could be that particular variants in an ASD population are more common.\n\n\n# Exporting variants to a table\n\nThis vcftools business makes it so easy! Not only can I sort (vcf-sort) and calculate statistics over the files (vcf-stats) or create a custom format file (vcf-query), I can in one swift command convert my file to a tab delimited table:\n\ncode\n\n\n# Sequencing Depth\n\nHere is how to get sequencing depth. Again, this would probably be useful to do some kind of filtering\u2026 I would imagine we would want to eliminate samples entirely that don\u2019t have a particular depth?:\n\ncode\n\n70 seems OK. If it were under 10, would that not be good enough? What is an acceptable depth?\n\n\n# Linkage Disequilibrium\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what this is \u2013 I seem to remember Maude explaining to me that there are chunks on chromosomes that don\u2019t get flopped around when DNA does it\u2019s recombination thing, and so as a result of that you have sets of alleles \/ genes that tend to stick around together. So (I think) that doing this, we do a pairwise comparison of our data and find markers that travel together over time? And I (think) this is how you would do that:\n\ncode\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019d want that now, so I\u2019m going to skip it over. What I\u2019d really like to do\n\n\n# Putting this all together\u2026\n\nWe now want to write a specific command to achieve our goal. What do we want to do again?\n\n1. Compile all vcfs into one  \n 2. Filter down to calls with good quality  \n 3. Identify rare variants (less than 1% of population, reference)  \n 4. Write rare variants into a big matrix! (for further analysis in R)\n\nLet\u2019s do this, and write a script to perform what we want to do!\n\n\n## [parseVCF.sh: A compilation of the stuff above to go from VCF \u2013> tab delimited data file for R (currently in progress!)](https:\/\/github.com\/vsoch\/vvcftools\/blob\/master\/parseVCF.sh)\n\n\n","html":"<p>If you just want to learn from the scripts I&#8217;m working on: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vsoch\/vvcftools\/blob\/master\/parseVCF.sh\" target=\"_blank\">SCRIPTS<\/a><br \/>\nAnd as a subset of this post, if you want to learn about using awk to <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/2014\/09\/basic-awk-to-tweak-data-files\/\">work with text files<\/a><\/p>\n<h1>What is variant analysis?<\/h1>\n<p>We all know that our genes have a lot to say about phenotype: we spend countless time and money to search for genetic markers that could predict disease, and in the future we would want to be able to change these markers to prevent it. We also have different theories for how we think about the relationship between genes and disease. The <strong>common variant model<\/strong> of disease says that there are a bunch of variations in our genetic code that are pretty common, and it&#8217;s when you get a particular combination of these common\u00a0variants that you develop disease. \u00a0The <strong>rare variant model<\/strong> says that disease can be accounted for by a much smaller number of rare variants (perhaps that are only present in an individual or family.) \u00a0I&#8217;m not going to state\u00a0that one is more right than the other, however my opinion is that the rare variant model makes more sense in the context of diseases like autism for which we still haven&#8217;t found a &#8220;genetic signature&#8221; in the most typical places to look. \u00a0Where are those places? We typically look at protein coding sequences of the genome (called the &#8220;exome&#8221;), across a bunch of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [<a href=\"http:\/\/www.snpedia.com\/index.php\/SNPedia\" target=\"_blank\">snpedia<\/a>]. \u00a0What are we looking at, exactly?<\/p>\n<p>When we look at someones genetic code, you may remember that genes are made of the base pairs ATCG, called nucleotides. And you may also know that while we are all very similar in this sequence, there are random insertions, deletions, or other kinds of variation that happens. Is this good or bad? Well, a lot of the mutations don&#8217;t really do anything that is totally obvious to us. However, sometimes if a mutation changes the function of a gene (meaning that a protein is not coded, or is coded differently), this could lead to phenotypic changes (some of which might be linked to the disease!) So when we want to study diseases (and possible find explanations for them), we are interested in finding these mutations. \u00a0So in a nutshell, &#8220;variant analysis&#8221; is looking at variations in our genetic sequence, and hoping to link those variations to disease.<\/p>\n<h1>What is a vcf file?<\/h1>\n<p>In biomedical informatics we are very good at making standard file formats. A vcf file is just a formatted text file in &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Variant_Call_Format\" target=\"_blank\">variant call format<\/a>,&#8221; meaning that it is full of information about variants! \u00a0And here we are at this post. \u00a0I need to learn how to parse a vcf file to find rare variants. First let\u00a0me\u00a0(broadly) set up the analysis that I\u00a0want to do:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define a threshold of &#8220;rare&#8221; to be represented in &lt;1% of the population<\/li>\n<li>Extract these rare variants<\/li>\n<li>Filter down the set to only include deleterious or important<\/li>\n<li>Map these variants to genes<\/li>\n<li>Add in some (intelligent?) weighting, (to be thought about later)<\/li>\n<li>DAVID (more on this later)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The first step is to get a vcf file. I am using one from our autism dataset.<\/p>\n<p>Next, we should decide how to work with this file. It is again notable that the file is just a text file &#8211; there is nothing magic or compiled about it <img src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" \/> This means that if we wanted, we could write our own script with bash, python, R, etc. However, there are already tools that are made for this! Let&#8217;s download (and learn) the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/vcftools.sourceforge.net\/downloads.html\" target=\"_blank\">vcftools<\/a>\u00a0and a nice little package for working with big text tables called <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/samtools\/files\/tabix\/\" target=\"_blank\">tabix<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>First, get the vcftools with subversion:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\nsvn checkout http:\/\/svn.code.sf.net\/p\/vcftools\/code\/trunk\/ vcftools\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>Note this means you can always then cd to your vcftools directory and type &#8220;svn update&#8221; to do exactly that.

Why did someone come up with it? Well, if we stored an ENTIRE genome, that is a MASSIVE file. Someone smart a while back figured out that we could store a &#8220;standard human genome&#8221; (we call this a reference), and then a second file (the vcf) that describes how one or more people vary from this reference. It starts with lots of header fields for meta information, and then is basically rows and rows of variants, each of which has meta information of its own! Let&#8217;s take a look at what this might look like. I&#8217;m going to steal this right off of wikipedia:<\/p>\n<p>The junk at the top with ## before it are all meta (header) information fields. For example, if you were opening this file for the first time, you might want to know how it was filtered, and what different annotations in the file mean (e.g., AA == Ancestral Allele&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>When the double ## goes down to a single #, these are the field names that describe the following rows, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CHROM: Chromosome number<\/li>\n<li>POS: Position on the chromosome<\/li>\n<li>ID: If (for example) a SNP has a particular ID (rs*)<\/li>\n<li>REF: This is the base that is found in the reference genome<\/li>\n<li>ALT: This is the alternate allele found in the sample&#8217;s genome<\/li>\n<li>QUAL: This is a quality score, called a &#8220;Phred quality score&#8221; http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phred_quality_score, 10log_10 prob(call in ALT is wrong).<\/li>\n<li>FILTER: If the nucleotide passes all filters, it will say PASS. if it says something else, this is the filter that was not passed<\/li>\n<li>INFO: NS means &#8220;number of samples&#8221; and you should look up the link provided below to see what all the other acronyms mean!<\/li>\n<li>FORMAT: the stuff here explains what the numbers mean in the next set of columns (the samples). For example,<\/li>\n<li>GT:GQ:DP:HQ says that the first thing is a genotype, followed by a conditional genotype quality, a read depth, and haplotype qualities. For the genotype, the | means phased and \/ means unphased.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<pre class=\"brush: \r\n##fileformat=vcfv4.0\r\n##filedate=20110705\r\n##reference=1000genomespilot-ncbi37\r\n##phasing=partial\r\n##info=<id=ns,number=1,type=integer,description=\"number of samples with data\">\r\n##info=<id=dp,number=1,type=integer,description=\"total depth\">\r\n##info=<id=af,number=.,type=float,description=\"allele frequency\">\r\n##info=<id=aa,number=1,type=string,description=\"ancestral allele\">\r\n##info=<id=db,number=0,type=flag,description=\"dbsnp membership, build 129\">\r\n##info=<id=h2,number=0,type=flag,description=\"hapmap2 membership\">\r\n##filter=<id=q10,description=\"quality below 10\">\r\n##filter=<id=s50,description=\"less than 50% of samples have data\">\r\n##format=<id=gq,number=1,type=integer,description=\"genotype quality\">\r\n##format=<id=gt,number=1,type=string,description=\"genotype\">\r\n##format=<id=dp,number=1,type=integer,description=\"read depth\">\r\n##format=<id=hq,number=2,type=integer,description=\"haplotype quality\">\r\n#chrom pos    id        ref  alt     qual filter info                              format      sample1        sample2        sample3\r\n2      4370   rs6057    g    a       29   .      ns=2;dp=13;af=0.5;db;h2           gt:gq:dp:hq 0|0:48:1:52,51 1|0:48:8:51,51 1\/1:43:5:.,.\r\n2      7330   .         t    a       3    q10    ns=5;dp=12;af=0.017               gt:gq:dp:hq 0|0:46:3:58,50 0|1:3:5:65,3   0\/0:41:3\r\n2      110696 rs6055    a    g,t     67   pass   ns=2;dp=10;af=0.333,0.667;aa=t;db gt:gq:dp:hq 1|2:21:6:23,27 2|1:2:0:18,2   2\/2:35:4\r\n2      130237 .         t    .       47   .      ns=2;dp=16;aa=t                   gt:gq:dp:hq 0|0:54:7:56,60 0|0:48:4:56,51 0\/0:61:2\r\n2      134567 microsat1 gtct g,gtact 50   pass   ns=2;dp=9;aa=g                    gt:gq:dp    0\/1:35:4       0\/2:17:2       1\/1:40:3\r\n\">code<\/pre>\n<p>This is why you should not be afraid when someone mentions a vcf file.

I think more importantly in this file is the Allele Frequency &#8211; for example having A for 949654 is super rare! Again, this is calculating frequencies across our vcf files. I think if we are looking for variants in autism, for example, we would want to compare to a reference genome, because it could be that particular variants in an ASD population are more common.<\/p>\n<h1>Exporting variants to a table<\/h1>\n<p>This vcftools business makes it so easy!

So (I think) that doing this, we do a pairwise comparison of our data and find markers that travel together over time?

Start \/ lead a company that will do big, great things\n2. Be employed at a company to do big, great things\n3. Become a PI to foster a relationship with said private entities\n\nI think all of these options are great. \u00a0But I still have about two years left. \u00a0And as I finish up this current work mapping genes to brain to disorder, I\u2019m haunted by the question of **1)** my ability to truly demonstrate clinical applicability in the short scope of graduate school, and **2)** what I should work on next that could be useful, and **3)** if any work that can be done in the scope of a graduate school career can ever really be as meaningful as I\u2019d want it to be (in cases where it does happen, maybe it is just luck?)\n\n\n# \n\n\n# What am I supposed to be doing?\n\nIt\u2019s my \u201cjob\u201d to come up with a well scoped project, and follow through and complete it for a thesis. \u00a0I guess that doesn\u2019t seem so hard, I\u2019m almost done. \u00a0But with two years to go (the golden rule is that you can pretty much go as long as you have funding) I am looking critically at my own work, and craving challenge. \u00a0I am pretty good at bringing together completely loony ideas, testing them out, and sometimes stumbling on a use of data or methods that is (mostly) useless, but minimally, cool, but that doesn\u2019t feel like enough. \u00a0I have (recently) been trying to think of \u201cbigger\u201d problems in medicine, specifically with imaging, since I am coined as an \u201cimaging person.\u201d \u00a0The problem is that there is so much issue with the current infrastructure with regard to acquisition and sharing of the data that there is nothing to build on top of. \u00a0Assuming easy access to data, the other problem is that imaging is just not as great as we want it to be. \u00a0It\u2019s another marker of phenotype (and thus important) but we aren\u2019t going to find single biomarkers for some disorder in, for example, a brain scan. \u00a0What we can find are interesting relationships between genes, behavior, and brain, but I\u2019m not convinced that finding such a relationship,\u00a0and\u00a0publishing on it, is really so useful. \u00a0Do we really need a highly expensive brainscan to tell us that someone is depressed? Just ask them. \u00a0When we find genes that can explain some tiny percentage of risk for a disorder \u2013 is that really so useful?\n\nAnyway, aside from my skepticism about this, as a graduate student I am pressed to ask myself \u201cWhat am I supposed to be doing?\u201d \u00a0Aside from my well scoped thesis work, I (*think*) that I should be hammering my head against some unsolved problem in the field. \u00a0So then I can ask myself \u2013 what is that problem?

Just ask them. \u00a0When we find genes that can explain some tiny percentage of risk for a disorder &#8211; is that really so useful?<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, aside from my skepticism about this, as a graduate student I am pressed to ask myself &#8220;What am I supposed to be doing?&#8221; \u00a0Aside from my well scoped thesis work, I (*think*) that I should be hammering my head against some unsolved problem in the field. \u00a0So then I can ask myself &#8211; what is that problem?

\u00a0It\u2019s a lot harder in imaging, because of the complexity of the data. \u00a0However, we are getting better! \u00a0I\u2019m excited about projects like [NeuroVault](http:\/\/www.neurovault.org), [OpenFmri](https:\/\/openfmri.org\/), [ABIDE](http:\/\/fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org\/indi\/abide\/), [LONI](http:\/\/pipeline.loni.usc.edu\/), [NDAR](http:\/\/ndar.nih.gov\/), [HCP](http:\/\/www.humanconnectomeproject.org\/), [INDI](http:\/\/fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org\/), \u00a0and I could probably go on.\u00a0\u00a0 The problem we still face, however, is that it\u2019s really hard to bring together lots of researchers\u2019 data to make inferences over, and even harder to connect to other kinds of data (behavior, genetic, metabolic, clinical, etc) or even simple things like demographics. \u00a0There are huge privacy issues \u2013 seeing someone\u2019s nose, or having just a few fields of demographics, is usually enough to identify the person. \u00a0So, the next decade of important work in neuroscience (and what I hope to be a big part of, just let me finish up this graduate school thing!) is going to be designing infrastructure to work with neuroimaging in a \u201cbig data\u201d way. \u00a0That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n## The Chi-Squared test of Independence in context of voxels\n\nReturning to the original goal: We start with two sets of pubmed ids, the first is for some \u201cfeature\u201d of interest, and the second serves as a control. \u00a0The control could be the entire database of NeuroSynth (sans our papers of interest) OR a different set entirely. \u00a0Now I am digging into the [NeuroSynth meta analysis code](https:\/\/github.com\/neurosynth\/neurosynth\/blob\/master\/neurosynth\/analysis\/meta.py). \u00a0\u00a0We call these two sets of ids \u201cids1\u201d (feature) and \u201cids2\u201d (control). \u00a0The script checks to see if the second set exists, and if it does, we use ids2 as the control. \u00a0If it doesn\u2019t, then the control is the rest of the database. \u00a0For this example, I\u2019m going to say that ids1 has 16 ids, and ids2 has 18. \u00a0Remember that, for each voxel, we are counting the number of papers that report activation in that voxel in the first set versus the control. \u00a0We want to know if there is a different proportion of counts (reported activations) between the feature and controls.\n\nWe first calculate the probability of the \u201cfeature\u201d \u2013 meaning the number of pmids in ids1, divided by the total number of mappables (16+18) = 34\n\n> pF = (n_selected * 1.0) \/ n_mappables\n\nAh, here it is! \u00a0My question is answered\u2026 where is the Staples button? This is why there is\u00a0\u00a0a difference between giving the method one vs the other ordering of the ids. In one case we get a pF of 0.47, and in the other we get 0.53. We are just switching between the feature set and control. \u00a0This is to say that the \u201cprobability\u201d of the feature (the papers tagged with something you found interesting) as a percentage of \u201call the papers\u201d (the entire set of 34) is X. \u00a0Next the script is essentially counting things, and calculating probabilities. \u00a0I found a[ fantastic site](http:\/\/www.ling.upenn.edu\/~clight\/chisquared.htm) that reviews how to do the test, and I\u2019ll try to summarize the high level stuffs.\n\nFor each voxel, we are basically making a table of counts for our feature of interest versus activation being present or activation. \u00a0I think it would look like this:\n\n**Voxel x,y,z**\n\n[su_table]\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td>Count if Activation Reported<\/td><td>Count if Activation Not Reported<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Papers in set \u201cids1\u201d<\/td><td>a<\/td><td>b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Papers in set \u201cids2\u201d<\/td><td>c<\/td><td>d<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>[\/su_table]\n\nYou can use this table in context of the explanation at the link above. \u00a0The null\u00a0hypothesis\u00a0says that whether activation is reported (or not) is independent from our feature of interest (meaning that the distributions of counts are pretty much the same between ids1 and ids2). \u00a0If we reject the null hypothesis, it means that we\u2019ve found activation to not be independent of the feature, meaning that the\u00a0distributions\u00a0are in fact different! \u00a0We can take a look at the equation:\n\n![](http:\/\/www.ling.upenn.edu\/~clight\/chi.png)\n\nthe O guy is the observed frequency (the count of voxels with reported activation in our set of ids1 papers) and the E guy is the expected frequency\u00a0(the control, or \u00a0number of activations for that coordinate in the set of ids2). SO if those two things are the same, we basically wind up at zero. When we subtract the two, the difference is called the residual, and squaring it ensures that we don\u2019t have a negative number. \u00a0We are using the test to ask for\u00a0the probability that our \u201cfeature\u201d (the\u00a0activations\u00a0reported for a single voxel across all papers in ids1) are independent from the control (the other set of papers). If, at one voxel, there is no difference in finding activation for the set of papers in ids1 vs ids2, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis. My interpretation of that in \u201cVanessa human\u201d language is that the literature is the same for the papers. \u00a0Thankfully, you (and by you I mean me) don\u2019t have to do this test out by hand \u2013 there are plenty of functions in R and python to perform the test given an input table, and spit out a p-value. \u00a0For neuroimaging, however, remember that we are performing this test at every single voxel, and so we must adjust our p-values for multiple comparisons. \u00a0A significant result suggests that there is a significant dependence between the feature of interest (represented in the set of papers) and activation at that voxel.\n\nI should probably get back to work! \u00a0Coding is great, but sometimes it\u2019s a good practice to read and write about things.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I am actively walking through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.neurosynth.org\">NeuroSynth<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/neurosynth\/neurosynth\/blob\/master\/neurosynth\/analysis\/meta.py\" target=\"_blank\">meta analysis code<\/a>, and I thought it would be helpful (for me) to write it down. \u00a0I&#8217;m interested because I noticed that when performing a meta analysis with two sets of pubmed IDs, switching the order of the ids into the function changes the resulting map. \u00a0I need to know why that is. \u00a0And of course I&#8217;ll forget everything entirely at some point, so I should put it here. \u00a0This is a high level thinking about a chi-squared test of independence in the context of brain imaging study literature. \u00a0Here is a little background.<\/p>\n<h2>How do we report results in neuroimaging?<\/h2>\n<p>In neuroimaging, it&#8217;s custom to report activation coordinates in tables. \u00a0This could mean a cluster center, or a maximum value, and it could be reporting significant differences between groups, or something else entirely. \u00a0For NeuroSynth, the current database does not take any context into account. \u00a0We are just mining these papers for x y z voxel coordinates, and making a huge table of imaging voxel locations (about 2 million to be exact) by pubmed paper IDS (currently there are 9721 in the database). \u00a0You can imagine a 1 indicates that activation is reported in the paper, and 0 not. \u00a0I haven&#8217;t kept up to date <a href=\"http:\/\/wagerlab.colorado.edu\/files\/papers\/Yarkoni_2011_NatMethods_neurosynth.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">with the database methods<\/a>, but I remember something to the effect of\u00a0a 1 being\u00a0assigned to each value in this matrix within 10mm of a reported activation.<\/p>\n<p>Now you understand the matrix: it shows us which papers have reported what. \u00a0Now we can start to ask questions. \u00a0For example, for a set of papers I&#8217;m interested in, I want to know if the x,y,z coordinates reported (the &#8220;voxels&#8221; of activation) are similar or different from some &#8220;control&#8221; set of papers. \u00a0If my set of papers are neuroimaging studies about anxiety, for example, my ideal analysis would tell me, for each voxel, if the expected frequency of reported activations for this voxel (in my control set) is different from the observed reported activations (in my anxiety set). \u00a0A difference in frequency could mean that you are more likely to see those voxels of activation reported in anxiety papers. \u00a0That translates to suggesting that the literature is showing those regions of the brain to be more strongly associated with our set of papers. \u00a0If our set of papers are about anxiety, we can then infer that those parts of the brain are the important ones in the experience of anxiety. \u00a0This is why NeuroSynth is considered a &#8220;meta&#8221; analytical approach: it aims to summarize the literature in the database to come to a &#8220;large-scale&#8221; understanding of what we have studied about the brain.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>How <em>should<\/em>\u00a0we report results in neuroimaging?<\/h2>\n<p>Methods like NeuroSynth have come to be because sharing data, or results, in neuroimaging is really hard. \u00a0The files are really big. \u00a0Everyone analyzes their data differently. \u00a0Some PIs are incredibly protective of their data and don&#8217;t want to share until all analyses have been sucked dry. \u00a0This line of thought is outside of the scope of this post, however I can&#8217;t continue without saying something. \u00a0In many fields (genomics comes to mind, proteomics, drugs), we are pretty good at sharing data. \u00a0All of <em>that<\/em> data is just glorified text files, right?

We are just switching between the feature set and control. \u00a0This is to say that the &#8220;probability&#8221; of the feature (the papers tagged with something you found interesting) as a percentage of &#8220;all the papers&#8221; (the entire set of 34) is X. \u00a0Next the script is essentially counting things, and calculating probabilities. \u00a0I found a<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ling.upenn.edu\/~clight\/chisquared.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> fantastic site<\/a> that reviews how to do the test, and I&#8217;ll try to summarize the high level stuffs.<\/p>\n<p>For each voxel, we are basically making a table of counts for our feature of interest versus activation being present or activation. \u00a0I think it would look like this:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Voxel x,y,z<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[su_table]<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Count if Activation Reported<\/td>\n<td>Count if Activation Not Reported<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Papers in set &#8220;ids1&#8221;<\/td>\n<td>a<\/td>\n<td>b<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Papers in set &#8220;ids2&#8221;<\/td>\n<td>c<\/td>\n<td>d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>[\/su_table]<\/p>\n<p>You can use this table in context of the explanation at the link above. \u00a0The null\u00a0hypothesis\u00a0says that whether activation is reported (or not) is independent from our feature of interest (meaning that the distributions of counts are pretty much the same between ids1 and ids2). \u00a0If we reject the null hypothesis, it means that we&#8217;ve found activation to not be independent of the feature, meaning that the\u00a0distributions\u00a0are in fact different! \u00a0We can take a look at the equation:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ling.upenn.edu\/~clight\/chi.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"170\" height=\"49\" \/><\/p>\n<p>the O guy is the observed frequency (the count of voxels with reported activation in our set of ids1 papers) and the E guy is the expected frequency\u00a0(the control, or \u00a0number of activations for that coordinate in the set of ids2). SO if those two things are the same, we basically wind up at zero. When we subtract the two, the difference is called the residual, and squaring it ensures that we don&#8217;t have a negative number. \u00a0We are using the test to ask for\u00a0the probability that our &#8220;feature&#8221; (the\u00a0activations\u00a0reported for a single voxel across all papers in ids1) are independent from the control (the other set of papers). If, at one voxel, there is no difference in finding activation for the set of papers in ids1 vs ids2, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis. My interpretation of that in &#8220;Vanessa human&#8221; language is that the literature is the same for the papers. \u00a0Thankfully, you (and by you I mean me) don&#8217;t have to do this test out by hand &#8211; there are plenty of functions in R and python to perform the test given an input table, and spit out a p-value. \u00a0For neuroimaging, however, remember that we are performing this test at every single voxel, and so we must adjust our p-values for multiple comparisons. \u00a0A significant result suggests that there is a significant dependence between the feature of interest (represented in the set of papers) and activation at that voxel.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably get back to work! \u00a0Coding is great, but sometimes it&#8217;s a good practice to read and write about things.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 23:16:04 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 23:22:20 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 23:16:04 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1830,"title":"The Graduate Student Avatar!","slug":"the-graduate-student-avatar","markdown":"\nWhat does it take to be an imaging scientist? What is an imaging scientist? This is a question that crosses my mind every so often when someone asks me about my \u201cgoals.\u201d Do people think about goals regularly? I don\u2019t. But I\u2019m an intense person, and I pursue things aggressively and (in graduate school) without much fear of this thing called \u201cfailure.\u201d (This can be the topic of a separate post, I realized along the way that as long as I work hard at things, even if my path is a little bumpy, as long as I don\u2019t give up I can never really \u201cfail\u201d in the catastrophic sense that would inspire amygdala-driven fear). I don\u2019t really do things for some ulterior motive \u2013 I do things that are fun, and things that make me happy, and if the things I do on a regular basis (that some might label as \u201cwork\u201d) didn\u2019t make me feel this way, I wouldn\u2019t do them. I just like making things, and I wouldn\u2019t be writing this now if there wasn\u2019t some inherent joy in it. I would suggest from this observation that not consciously thinking about goals does not imply that they do not exist, because any person on some kind of track (like graduate school) is arguably there to pursue a continuation of doing things he or she likes to do. So for this kind of personality-type, the goals are hard-wired, implied, and sometimes unconscious until they are pulled from the depths of the brain.\n\nBack to this question. When I am asked about goals, since I don\u2019t consciously set any, I frame my answer around continuing to do the things that I like to do. In that scope, I look at my environment and decide that this \u201cthing\u201d I\u2019m doing is probably being an imaging scientist, which is probably a subtype of data analysis. The question is, then, what does it mean to be an imaging scientist, and since in the United States we are obsessed with this concept of \u201csuccess,\u201d what does it mean to be a GREAT imaging scientist? I have some thoughts.\n\nWe can actually frame this in the context of computer games. There are different levels of imagers, from noobs that are just getting started and haven\u2019t even made the connection between pixels and numbers (me circa 2009), and super-experts that can build and do anything that they think of. This latter group, then, is the highest level of the hierarchy and what we can define as \u201cexpert\u201d or \u201csuccessful.\u201d Here comes the fun part! I want to answer this question by defining my own level system, as if we had a computer game with an \u201cimaging scientist\u201d as a class. Actually, we don\u2019t even need to restrict it to \u201cimaging scientist,\u201d we can talk generally about people in \u201cdata science.\u201d\u00a0 First, let\u2019s define the buckets of skills that we can evaluate. Each of these buckets has its own dimension, so you could define yourself along each one to come up with your final avatar. Note to self: add this \u201cmake your own academic avatar\u201d to a list of fun web-interface projects to make at some point in life!\n\n- domain expertise\n- programming\n- methods\n- communication\n\nNow I want to talk about the details of these domains. Here I am going to communicate my bias. It might make some people upset, so I\u2019ll preface these thoughts with the understanding that this is my opinion, and you are welcome to disagree. I will put all of these statements in the context of myself, because I hold myself to them to some degree.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n# Domain Expertise\n\nThis is the hardest for me. Regardless of the field that I\u2019m in, I will have a hard time being successful if I can\u2019t ask interesting questions. I am terrible at this, because my natural way of thinking is to get excited about methods and tools, and then find an application to shove in. When I was interviewing for graduate school, actually, I had a pretty famous person tell me that \u201cPeople like me that don\u2019t have burning questions do not belong in PhD programs.\u201d I actually excused myself from the group, found a side hallway, and just cried. In retrospect I realized that the world needs both kind of people, those who use tools with interesting questions, and those that develop the tools themselves, and more important than bluntly stating that one is \u201cmore important\u201d than the other is recognizing the need for those groups to work together. So while I\u2019ve always struggled with the \u201cbiological domain\u201d part of \u201cbiomedical informatics,\u201d I\u2019m pushing myself to work harder on the question part, and surrounding myself with people that I can learn from. For this domain expertise, we can break it down further into three sub categories: the source of the question, the value of the question, and the impact of answering it:\n\n\n## Source:\n\n- **Level 1:** I am incapable of asking questions, perhaps I\u2019m a lemming with no brain?\n- **Level 2:** I can ask basic questions with much guidance from the literature, peers, or advisors.\n- **Level 3:** I can ask intermediate questions if I pursue guidance from peers, and push myself to\n- think about \u201cthe big picture.\u201d\n- **Level 4:** I can ask expert, interesting questions based on an intelligent synthesis of the people and sources of knowledge around me.\n\n\n## Value:\n\n- ** Level 1:** My question has been answered before, but I haven\u2019t done my homework to know that.\n- **Level 2:** My question has not appeared to have been answered before, and this might be the case because of positive publication bias.\n- **Level 3:** I have a basic skill-set and incentive to search the literature and determine if my question has been answered before.\n- **Level 4:** I have enough background and domain knowledge to evaluate the likelihood of if my question has been answered, and this understanding comes from having identified a gap in a method or process.\n\n\n## Impact:\n\n- **Level 1:** My Mom might be proud of me if I wrote a paper about it.\n- **Level 2**: Answering the question would have some value to a small, select group of people, but the rest of the world would ask \u201cWhy would anyone care about that?\u201d\n- **Level 3**: Answering the question would have a significant impact for the scientific community.\n- **Level 4:** Answering the question would have a significant impact for not only the scientific community, but also society at large. It\u2019s probably a Nature paper.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**For the above, I\u2019d say I\u2019m probably at:**  \n Source: 2  \n Value: 2  \n Impact: 1\n\nHaha. Like I said, I\u2019m terrible. Let\u2019s continue! This is fun ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n# Programming\n\nIn this day and age, if I am not in a \u201csoft\u201d science, if I finish graduate school without programming experience I did not try hard enough. It could be the case, however, that I finished without programming but was able to do my analysis with graphical software. That seems plausible, but what that really means is that I would then look for a job that has me doing that same limited set of clicking and pointing. If I aspire to do anything else other than this limited functionality, I\u2019d have to outsource it, and so why would anyone want to hire me when there are many people that can use the software and understand the underlying black box? Basically, for anyone that works with data, especially highly complex imaging data, I can\u2019t imagine being successful without being able to do things with it. The default understanding of a \u201cscientist\u201d is that you must make discoveries with some level of novelty, and most of the time the novelty means doing much more than clicking and pointing. I will say that there is room in the world for those that are more managerial scientists (e.g., having great ideas and maybe running a lab), and I think those individuals would be even better with some coding ability! For this bucket, I\u2019d say there are three levels: language depth, language breadth, and software development.\n\n\n## Language Breadth:\n\n- ** Level 1:** I know no languages, and I don\u2019t even work with data. I might write a Word document sometimes, but that\u2019s it. This is where, for example, my parents are. Sorry Mom and Dad!\n- **Level 2:** I have no coding skills, but I do work with data. I rely on Microsoft Excel and tried to open a data file in Microsoft Word, but it crashed my computer. It takes me inordinately long to do simple things that could be done with one line of sed or awk. What are those things?\n- **Level 3:** I have used 1-5 languages.\n- **Level 4:** I have used 6-10 languages.\n- **Level 5:** I have used more than 10 languages. I may not be a coding master, but I have impressive breadth!\n\n\n## Language Depth:\n\n- ** Level 1:** If languages are like black matter, then I\u2019m on the earth, because we just don\u2019t see one another.\n- **Level 2**: I can write a few basic lines, in say, Matlab, but only when I am absolutely forced to, and I find it painful and hard. Command lines aren\u2019t so bad, but I prefer graphical interfaces.\n- **Level 3:** I can write basic scripts. The idea of writing a function or anything beyond a few lines is kind of scary.\n- **Level 4:** I program with some frequency, and can figure out most of what I need. I am very particular about my choice of editor, and the coloring of my syntax.\n- **Level 5**: I don\u2019t even need to do Google searches. It flows out of my fingers like salami on a slope! I will argue with you for hours on the pros and cons of vim vs emacs, or whether your IDE of choice can trump my love for eclipse, sublime text, or atom.\n\n\n## Software Development:\n\n- **Level 1:** Still don\u2019t know any languages, captain.\n- **Level 2:** I wrote a paper that had some programming, but the little bits of pieces of my work are scattered everywhere. If you ask me to reproduce anything I will tar and feather you.\n- **Level 3:** I wrote a paper with some programming, and I have a nice script or two to go with it that can be shared if anyone asks! I just need to find it in my Dropbox\u2026\n- **Level 4:** I use version control, but it\u2019s mostly just me. I\u2019m not really sure how to collaborate in this github place.\n- **Level 5:** I work on projects with other people in a version-controlled environment, but mess up from time to time.\n- **Level 6:** I AM GITHUB MASTA! If you want to know me better as a person, you should really look at my repositories.\n- **Level 7:** I have actually worked as a developer in a large company.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**And my critique of myself:**  \n Language Breadth: 4  \n Language Depth: 4  \n Software Development: 5\n\nI\u2019m being kind to myself here, because if I had more awareness of how awesome the CS students are here, I\u2019d probably give myself 2\u2019s across the board, just one level up from Mom and Dad!\n\n\n## \n\n\n# Methods\n\nA skill-set in methods is highly dependent on the graduate program. A chemist should probably be in the 99th percentile of people that can put on white coats and mix dangerous things, and a data scientist should minimally know the high level methods, and when and how to apply them. In my field, statistics are also very important, along with machine learning and domain-specific processing protocols. My first foray into methods was related to preprocessing (loved it!) and then machine learning (also loved it!). The statistics part, which really comes down to mentally translating a bunch of symbols into mathematical steps, and then understanding the steps to take to convince the peanut gallery that your result isn\u2019t just random chance, is a lot harder. My strategy for understanding methods that are typically communicated with symbols is to put them into a language I do understand \u2013 some kind of code. One line of goppelty gook translated into for loops (or matrix multiplication), and being able to tangibly see the matrices I\u2019m working with, makes sense to me. This in effect may just be another data visualization strategy \u2013 perhaps I\u2019m visually inclined, and don\u2019t truly understand things until I see them. But statistics, overall, in that it is the language of methods, and that those awful symbols are used to communicate them, is something that I have to work really hard at. I\u2019m convinced that like learning a programming language, reading these symbols comfortably will just \u201cclick\u201d one day. For example, I remember years ago when I first saw a line of code in R, it looked like goppeltee gook. It just clicked one day, and now I practically dream in R. I don\u2019t see why statistics will be any different, but I do need to keep pushing myself to be exposed to the symbols. For methods, there are two categories: Implementation and Utilization, and Understanding\n\n\n## Implementation and Utilization\n\n- **Level 1:** A method\u2026 is that like a recipe in a book?\n- **Level 2:** I can follow a web tutorial and then try to reproduce it for my data.\n- **Level 3:** I can bring together different software, packages, and tools to do basic preprocessing, postprocessing, analysis, and statistical inference.\n- **Level 4:** I don\u2019t start with pipelines: I think of my data, and my goals, and develop and use a series of steps that are best fit to that.\n- **Level 5:** I not only use current methods intelligently and correctly, I am a bleeding edge developer that is defining the field.\n\n\n## Understanding\n\n- **Level 1:** I\u2019m completely new, and I\u2019ve only been exposed to \u201cmethods\u201d through reading the New York Times, or listening to NPR.\n- **Level 2:** I have a high level understanding of methods. This \u201cclustering\u201d bit means we group things that are similar. A regression involves lines?\n- **Level 3**: I know the methods that are important in my field, but I need lots of Wikipedia before being able to explain anything to anyone.\n- **Level 4:** I know the big picture of most of the big methods in my field, and I can explain most of them. For the details, I still might need some wikipedia. I might have even implemented some basic methods on my own.\n- **Level 5:** I\u2019m a well-established researcher, and I know this stuff so well I confidently use the BEST packages with the RIGHT parameter settings, and teach methods to others.\n- **Level 6:** I am a methods, and statistical master.\n- **Level 7:** I am one of the methodological powerhouses at Stanford, such as Daphe Koller, Andrew Ng, or Rob Tibshirani. If you aren\u2019t in my lab, I know you want to be.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**And now for where I fall in the methods buckets:**  \n Utilization: 3  \n Big Picture Understanding: 4\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n# Communication\n\nThis is broken into three categories: verbal, written, and visual. I think that many graduate school programs should expect more of us in terms of communication. Let\u2019s start with \u201cverbal.\u201d Presenting at a lab meeting, or to a small group a few times a year with scattered \u201cmilestone\u201d talks I don\u2019t think is representative of what we need to do in the \u201creal world.\u201d Regardless of whether an imaging scientist goes into academia or industry, if he\/she cannot stand in front of a large audience with a white board marker and properly communicate a complicated method, it\u2019s just not good enough. We should have regular experience with developing and presenting content. Serving as teaching assistants is a good idea, but this should be enhanced with actual course development, and minimally teaching a handful of full-length lectures.\n\nOn the written side of things, they do make us write quite a bit, so that is properly addressed. Keep in mind that academic writing is very different than personal writing or blogging (ahem, this post), and I\u2019m not sure how the two are related. I am totally incapable of being brief about anything, so I lose a lot of points in that department, but on the other hand, I can come up with some pretty fun metaphors, most of which would be totally inappropriate for an academic paper. A well-trained academic should be able to produce many different kinds of writing pretty painlessly and quickly.\n\nFinally, \u201cvisual\u201d communication. It was less than a year ago when I realized that I had a visualization of some data result in my head that I wasn\u2019t skilled enough to show in a meaningful way. This is actually the hardest of all of the skills, because it\u2019s most definitely feasible to survive as an imaging scientist using traditional software, and convincing others with confusion matrices and p-values. I found myself, however, not only wanting a visualization to supplement some result, but badly needing it to convince myself that it was meaningful, period.\n\n\n## Verbal Communication:\n\n- **Level 1:** I get anxious and mute if you stand me in front of a room of people. I might even fall over.\n- **Level 2:** I can give a presentation after many hours of practice, and mostly just reading the cards or slides in front of me.\n- **Level 3:** I can give a pretty good presentation with visual or written aids, but I still need to work on things like volume, eye contact, etc.\n- **Level 4:** I\u2019m not perfect, but I feel confident in my ability to engage a room of people.\n- **Level 5:** I am the verbal communication master. I am interesting, engaging, and funny.\n- **Level 6:** I am Russ Altman.\n\n\n## Written Communication:\n\n- **Level 1:** Like, omgwtfbbq! Lolz!\n- **Level 2:** I am a twitter masta, 140 characters or less is the name of my game.\n- **Level 3:** I had to make a resume and bio once, and it was pretty ok.\n- **Level 4:** I regularly journal, and I\u2019ve written an essay or two for an application.\n- **Level 5:** I\u2019ve written papers or abstracts, although I\u2019ve never published. I may or may not keep a journal.\n- **Level 6:** I\u2019ve published, and it sounds pretty ok! I regularly write in either a research or personal journal, and at least a handful of people have written some of my brain dumps.\n- **Level 7:** I have written grants, many publications, and regularly keep a research or academic journal with a substantial number of readers.\n- **Level 8:** I am a master of language, with several publications in well-respected journals. I have a way with words, and they come easily and regularly.\n- **Level 9:** Grant writing and publication defined the early part of my career, and now I\u2019m writing books.

You then need the methodological understanding to find the right steps in your toolbox to answer it, and prove to others that your answer is a good one, and the tangible software or programming skills to be able to implement these steps. Finally, you need the verbal, written, and visual communication skills to be able to convince others of the value of your work.\n\nNow for some fun \u2013 for each of the domains above, I can create my \u201cdata scientist avatar\u201d progress bars that I might see in a computer game to see how well I\u2019m doing at this \u201cgoal achieving\u201d thing.\n\n[![graduate_student_progress](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/graduate_student_progress.png)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/graduate_student_progress.png)\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t make a web application, you are welcome to play with my code!\n\n\n## [Graduate Student Avatar Gist](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/vsoch\/a68861dfcc1d5f13e1d2)\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Some flaws with the visualization above:**\n\n- It does not take the number of levels or difficulty into account\n- It doesn\u2019t reflect how I feel (or the importance) about the different domains, just how I evaluate myself\n- It does not properly represent progress for each of the higher domains, other than to show that (generally) I think I\u2019m best at programming, worst at domain knowledge.\n- It doesn\u2019t properly summarize \u201cthe whole\u201d picture, across domains\n\nHaha, I should probably not show those piddley green bars to any kind of panel that is evaluating me ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)\n\n> And I hope no one ever asks me about goals again! If they do, I\u2019m going to direct them here and say \u201cto get more points!\u201d\n\nI also want to point out that these are not necessarily goals, but artificial constructs that can be used to evaluate progress by one person\u2019s (my) standard.\u00a0 If I thought about skills in such a stark format on a regular basis, that would be kind of scary.\u00a0 If you want to go as far as to call these goals, I\u2019d say that thankfully they are convoluted into a framework centered around\u00a0 playing with data and having fun!\n\nWhat we all come to realize, however, is that it\u2019s impossible to make it to the highest levels of any of these domains. Maybe one person in the world, for a split second, could get a completely green bar, and then lose in in the next blink.\u00a0 There are also bars that are completely missing from this plot because I don\u2019t have the insight that they exist, period.\u00a0 Back to big picture thinking.\u00a0 There are always going to be people out there smarter and better than me at things, and it\u2019s much better to realize that, while there is substantial challenge and novelty by default, as long as we work hard and take on the mindset of learning for the rest of our lives, we will really enjoy what we do, feel challenged, and grow. So perhaps that is what it takes to be a great imaging scientist? I do hope that my stumbling around eventually leads to asymptoting around that: maintaining a level of being utterly, completely happy :O)\n\n\n","html":"<p>What does it take to be an imaging scientist? What is an imaging scientist? This is a question that crosses my mind every so often when someone asks me about my &#8220;goals.&#8221; Do people think about goals regularly? I don&#8217;t. But I&#8217;m an intense person, and I pursue things aggressively and (in graduate school) without much fear of this thing called &#8220;failure.&#8221; (This can be the topic of a separate post, I realized along the way that as long as I work hard at things, even if my path is a little bumpy, as long as I don&#8217;t give up I can never really &#8220;fail&#8221; in the catastrophic sense that would inspire amygdala-driven fear). I don&#8217;t really do things for some ulterior motive &#8211; I do things that are fun, and things that make me happy, and if the things I do on a regular basis (that some might label as &#8220;work&#8221;) didn&#8217;t make me feel this way, I wouldn&#8217;t do them. I just like making things, and I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this now if there wasn&#8217;t some inherent joy in it. I would suggest from this observation that not consciously thinking about goals does not imply that they do not exist, because any person on some kind of track (like graduate school) is arguably there to pursue a continuation of doing things he or she likes to do. So for this kind of personality-type, the goals are hard-wired, implied, and sometimes unconscious until they are pulled from the depths of the brain.<\/p>\n<p>Back to this question. When I am asked about goals, since I don&#8217;t consciously set any, I frame my answer around continuing to do the things that I like to do. In that scope, I look at my environment and decide that this &#8220;thing&#8221; I&#8217;m doing is probably being an imaging scientist, which is probably a subtype of data analysis. The question is, then, what does it mean to be an imaging scientist, and since in the United States we are obsessed with this concept of &#8220;success,&#8221; what does it mean to be a GREAT imaging scientist? I have some thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>We can actually frame this in the context of computer games. There are different levels of imagers, from noobs that are just getting started and haven&#8217;t even made the connection between pixels and numbers (me circa 2009), and super-experts that can build and do anything that they think of. This latter group, then, is the highest level of the hierarchy and what we can define as &#8220;expert&#8221; or &#8220;successful.&#8221; Here comes the fun part! I want to answer this question by defining my own level system, as if we had a computer game with an &#8220;imaging scientist&#8221; as a class. Actually, we don&#8217;t even need to restrict it to &#8220;imaging scientist,&#8221; we can talk generally about people in &#8220;data science.&#8221;\u00a0 First, let&#8217;s define the buckets of skills that we can evaluate. Each of these buckets has its own dimension, so you could define yourself along each one to come up with your final avatar. Note to self: add this &#8220;make your own academic avatar&#8221; to a list of fun web-interface projects to make at some point in life!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>domain expertise<\/li>\n<li>programming<\/li>\n<li>methods<\/li>\n<li>communication<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now I want to talk about the details of these domains. Here I am going to communicate my bias. It might make some people upset, so I&#8217;ll preface these thoughts with the understanding that this is my opinion, and you are welcome to disagree. I will put all of these statements in the context of myself, because I hold myself to them to some degree.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>Domain Expertise<\/h1>\n<p>This is the hardest for me. Regardless of the field that I&#8217;m in, I will have a hard time being successful if I can&#8217;t ask interesting questions. I am terrible at this, because my natural way of thinking is to get excited about methods and tools, and then find an application to shove in. When I was interviewing for graduate school, actually, I had a pretty famous person tell me that &#8220;People like me that don&#8217;t have burning questions do not belong in PhD programs.&#8221; I actually excused myself from the group, found a side hallway, and just cried. In retrospect I realized that the world needs both kind of people, those who use tools with interesting questions, and those that develop the tools themselves, and more important than bluntly stating that one is &#8220;more important&#8221; than the other is recognizing the need for those groups to work together. So while I&#8217;ve always struggled with the &#8220;biological domain&#8221; part of &#8220;biomedical informatics,&#8221; I&#8217;m pushing myself to work harder on the question part, and surrounding myself with people that I can learn from. For this domain expertise, we can break it down further into three sub categories: the source of the question, the value of the question, and the impact of answering it:<\/p>\n<h2>Source:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> I am incapable of asking questions, perhaps I&#8217;m a lemming with no brain?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> I can ask basic questions with much guidance from the literature, peers, or advisors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> I can ask intermediate questions if I pursue guidance from peers, and push myself to<\/li>\n<li>think about &#8220;the big picture.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I can ask expert, interesting questions based on an intelligent synthesis of the people and sources of knowledge around me.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Value:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Level 1:<\/strong> My question has been answered before, but I haven&#8217;t done my homework to know that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> My question has not appeared to have been answered before, and this might be the case because of positive publication bias.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> I have a basic skill-set and incentive to search the literature and determine if my question has been answered before.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I have enough background and domain knowledge to evaluate the likelihood of if my question has been answered, and this understanding comes from having identified a gap in a method or process.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Impact:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> My Mom might be proud of me if I wrote a paper about it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2<\/strong>: Answering the question would have some value to a small, select group of people, but the rest of the world would ask &#8220;Why would anyone care about that?&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3<\/strong>: Answering the question would have a significant impact for the scientific community.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> Answering the question would have a significant impact for not only the scientific community, but also society at large. It&#8217;s probably a Nature paper.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>For the above, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m probably at:<\/strong><br \/>\nSource: 2<br \/>\nValue: 2<br \/>\nImpact: 1<\/p>\n<p>Haha. Like I said, I&#8217;m terrible. Let&#8217;s continue! This is fun <img src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>Programming<\/h1>\n<p>In this day and age, if I am not in a &#8220;soft&#8221; science, if I finish graduate school without programming experience I did not try hard enough. It could be the case, however, that I finished without programming but was able to do my analysis with graphical software. That seems plausible, but what that really means is that I would then look for a job that has me doing that same limited set of clicking and pointing. If I aspire to do anything else other than this limited functionality, I&#8217;d have to outsource it, and so why would anyone want to hire me when there are many people that can use the software and understand the underlying black box? Basically, for anyone that works with data, especially highly complex imaging data, I can&#8217;t imagine being successful without being able to do things with it. The default understanding of a &#8220;scientist&#8221; is that you must make discoveries with some level of novelty, and most of the time the novelty means doing much more than clicking and pointing. I will say that there is room in the world for those that are more managerial scientists (e.g., having great ideas and maybe running a lab), and I think those individuals would be even better with some coding ability! For this bucket, I&#8217;d say there are three levels: language depth, language breadth, and software development.<\/p>\n<h2>Language Breadth:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Level 1:<\/strong> I know no languages, and I don&#8217;t even work with data. I might write a Word document sometimes, but that&#8217;s it. This is where, for example, my parents are. Sorry Mom and Dad!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> I have no coding skills, but I do work with data. I rely on Microsoft Excel and tried to open a data file in Microsoft Word, but it crashed my computer. It takes me inordinately long to do simple things that could be done with one line of sed or awk. What are those things?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> I have used 1-5 languages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I have used 6-10 languages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 5:<\/strong> I have used more than 10 languages. I may not be a coding master, but I have impressive breadth!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Language Depth:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Level 1:<\/strong> If languages are like black matter, then I&#8217;m on the earth, because we just don&#8217;t see one another.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2<\/strong>: I can write a few basic lines, in say, Matlab, but only when I am absolutely forced to, and I find it painful and hard. Command lines aren&#8217;t so bad, but I prefer graphical interfaces.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> I can write basic scripts. The idea of writing a function or anything beyond a few lines is kind of scary.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I program with some frequency, and can figure out most of what I need. I am very particular about my choice of editor, and the coloring of my syntax.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 5<\/strong>: I don&#8217;t even need to do Google searches. It flows out of my fingers like salami on a slope! I will argue with you for hours on the pros and cons of vim vs emacs, or whether your IDE of choice can trump my love for eclipse, sublime text, or atom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Software Development:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> Still don&#8217;t know any languages, captain.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> I wrote a paper that had some programming, but the little bits of pieces of my work are scattered everywhere. If you ask me to reproduce anything I will tar and feather you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> I wrote a paper with some programming, and I have a nice script or two to go with it that can be shared if anyone asks! I just need to find it in my Dropbox&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I use version control, but it&#8217;s mostly just me. I&#8217;m not really sure how to collaborate in this github place.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 5:<\/strong> I work on projects with other people in a version-controlled environment, but mess up from time to time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 6:<\/strong> I AM GITHUB MASTA! If you want to know me better as a person, you should really look at my repositories.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 7:<\/strong> I have actually worked as a developer in a large company.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>And my critique of myself:<\/strong><br \/>\nLanguage Breadth: 4<br \/>\nLanguage Depth: 4<br \/>\nSoftware Development: 5<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being kind to myself here, because if I had more awareness of how awesome the CS students are here, I&#8217;d probably give myself 2&#8217;s across the board, just one level up from Mom and Dad!<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h1>Methods<\/h1>\n<p>A skill-set in methods is highly dependent on the graduate program. A chemist should probably be in the 99th percentile of people that can put on white coats and mix dangerous things, and a data scientist should minimally know the high level methods, and when and how to apply them. In my field, statistics are also very important, along with machine learning and domain-specific processing protocols. My first foray into methods was related to preprocessing (loved it!) and then machine learning (also loved it!). The statistics part, which really comes down to mentally translating a bunch of symbols into mathematical steps, and then understanding the steps to take to convince the peanut gallery that your result isn&#8217;t just random chance, is a lot harder. My strategy for understanding methods that are typically communicated with symbols is to put them into a language I do understand &#8211; some kind of code. One line of goppelty gook translated into for loops (or matrix multiplication), and being able to tangibly see the matrices I&#8217;m working with, makes sense to me. This in effect may just be another data visualization strategy &#8211; perhaps I&#8217;m visually inclined, and don&#8217;t truly understand things until I see them. But statistics, overall, in that it is the language of methods, and that those awful symbols are used to communicate them, is something that I have to work really hard at. I&#8217;m convinced that like learning a programming language, reading these symbols comfortably will just &#8220;click&#8221; one day. For example, I remember years ago when I first saw a line of code in R, it looked like goppeltee gook. It just clicked one day, and now I practically dream in R. I don&#8217;t see why statistics will be any different, but I do need to keep pushing myself to be exposed to the symbols. For methods, there are two categories: Implementation and Utilization, and Understanding<\/p>\n<h2>Implementation and Utilization<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> A method&#8230; is that like a recipe in a book?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> I can follow a web tutorial and then try to reproduce it for my data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> I can bring together different software, packages, and tools to do basic preprocessing, postprocessing, analysis, and statistical inference.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I don&#8217;t start with pipelines: I think of my data, and my goals, and develop and use a series of steps that are best fit to that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 5:<\/strong> I not only use current methods intelligently and correctly, I am a bleeding edge developer that is defining the field.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Understanding<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> I&#8217;m completely new, and I&#8217;ve only been exposed to &#8220;methods&#8221; through reading the New York Times, or listening to NPR.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> I have a high level understanding of methods. This &#8220;clustering&#8221; bit means we group things that are similar. A regression involves lines?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3<\/strong>: I know the methods that are important in my field, but I need lots of Wikipedia before being able to explain anything to anyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I know the big picture of most of the big methods in my field, and I can explain most of them. For the details, I still might need some wikipedia. I might have even implemented some basic methods on my own.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 5:<\/strong> I&#8217;m a well-established researcher, and I know this stuff so well I confidently use the BEST packages with the RIGHT parameter settings, and teach methods to others.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 6:<\/strong> I am a methods, and statistical master.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 7:<\/strong> I am one of the methodological powerhouses at Stanford, such as Daphe Koller, Andrew Ng, or Rob Tibshirani. If you aren&#8217;t in my lab, I know you want to be.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>And now for where I fall in the methods buckets:<\/strong><br \/>\nUtilization: 3<br \/>\nBig Picture Understanding: 4<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>Communication<\/h1>\n<p>This is broken into three categories: verbal, written, and visual. I think that many graduate school programs should expect more of us in terms of communication. Let&#8217;s start with &#8220;verbal.&#8221; Presenting at a lab meeting, or to a small group a few times a year with scattered &#8220;milestone&#8221; talks I don&#8217;t think is representative of what we need to do in the &#8220;real world.&#8221; Regardless of whether an imaging scientist goes into academia or industry, if he\/she cannot stand in front of a large audience with a white board marker and properly communicate a complicated method, it&#8217;s just not good enough. We should have regular experience with developing and presenting content. Serving as teaching assistants is a good idea, but this should be enhanced with actual course development, and minimally teaching a handful of full-length lectures.<\/p>\n<p>On the written side of things, they do make us write quite a bit, so that is properly addressed. Keep in mind that academic writing is very different than personal writing or blogging (ahem, this post), and I&#8217;m not sure how the two are related. I am totally incapable of being brief about anything, so I lose a lot of points in that department, but on the other hand, I can come up with some pretty fun metaphors, most of which would be totally inappropriate for an academic paper. A well-trained academic should be able to produce many different kinds of writing pretty painlessly and quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, &#8220;visual&#8221; communication. It was less than a year ago when I realized that I had a visualization of some data result in my head that I wasn&#8217;t skilled enough to show in a meaningful way. This is actually the hardest of all of the skills, because it&#8217;s most definitely feasible to survive as an imaging scientist using traditional software, and convincing others with confusion matrices and p-values. I found myself, however, not only wanting a visualization to supplement some result, but badly needing it to convince myself that it was meaningful, period.<\/p>\n<h2>Verbal Communication:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> I get anxious and mute if you stand me in front of a room of people. I might even fall over.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> I can give a presentation after many hours of practice, and mostly just reading the cards or slides in front of me.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> I can give a pretty good presentation with visual or written aids, but I still need to work on things like volume, eye contact, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I&#8217;m not perfect, but I feel confident in my ability to engage a room of people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 5:<\/strong> I am the verbal communication master. I am interesting, engaging, and funny.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 6:<\/strong> I am Russ Altman.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Written Communication:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1:<\/strong> Like, omgwtfbbq! Lolz!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 2:<\/strong> I am a twitter masta, 140 characters or less is the name of my game.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 3:<\/strong> I had to make a resume and bio once, and it was pretty ok.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 4:<\/strong> I regularly journal, and I&#8217;ve written an essay or two for an application.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 5:<\/strong> I&#8217;ve written papers or abstracts, although I&#8217;ve never published. I may or may not keep a journal.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 6:<\/strong> I&#8217;ve published, and it sounds pretty ok! I regularly write in either a research or personal journal, and at least a handful of people have written some of my brain dumps.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 7:<\/strong> I have written grants, many publications, and regularly keep a research or academic journal with a substantial number of readers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 8:<\/strong> I am a master of language, with several publications in well-respected journals. I have a way with words, and they come easily and regularly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Level 9:<\/strong> Grant writing and publication defined the early part of my career, and now I&#8217;m writing books.

You then need the methodological understanding to find the right steps in your toolbox to answer it, and prove to others that your answer is a good one, and the tangible software or programming skills to be able to implement these steps. Finally, you need the verbal, written, and visual communication skills to be able to convince others of the value of your work.<\/p>\n<p>Now for some fun &#8211; for each of the domains above, I can create my &#8220;data scientist avatar&#8221; progress bars that I might see in a computer game to see how well I&#8217;m doing at this &#8220;goal achieving&#8221; thing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/graduate_student_progress.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1831\" src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/graduate_student_progress.png\" alt=\"graduate_student_progress\" width=\"955\" height=\"662\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While I didn&#8217;t make a web application, you are welcome to play with my code!<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/vsoch\/a68861dfcc1d5f13e1d2\" target=\"_blank\">Graduate Student Avatar Gist<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some flaws with the visualization above:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It does not take the number of levels or difficulty into account<\/li>\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t reflect how I feel (or the importance) about the different domains, just how I evaluate myself<\/li>\n<li>It does not properly represent progress for each of the higher domains, other than to show that (generally) I think I&#8217;m best at programming, worst at domain knowledge.<\/li>\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t properly summarize &#8220;the whole&#8221; picture, across domains<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Haha, I should probably not show those piddley green bars to any kind of panel that is evaluating me <img src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>And I hope no one ever asks me about goals again!

Maybe one person in the world, for a split second, could get a completely green bar, and then lose in in the next blink.\u00a0 There are also bars that are completely missing from this plot because I don&#8217;t have the insight that they exist, period.\u00a0 Back to big picture thinking.\u00a0 There are always going to be people out there smarter and better than me at things, and it&#8217;s much better to realize that, while there is substantial challenge and novelty by default, as long as we work hard and take on the mindset of learning for the rest of our lives, we will really enjoy what we do, feel challenged, and grow. So perhaps that is what it takes to be a great imaging scientist? I do hope that my stumbling around eventually leads to asymptoting around that: maintaining a level of being utterly, completely happy :O)<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 00:16:21 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 00:39:15 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 00:16:21 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1846,"title":"Spoons","slug":"spoons","markdown":"\nSpoons are very special to me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u00a0 It\u2019s possibly because of the fact that it\u2019s the only utensil I regularly use, and I typically have one special spoon that lasts for years and then breaks or gets lost\u00a0 (since graduate school I\u2019ve gone through a hello kitty, a beauty and the beast, a scooby doo, and now a flowers spoon.)\u00a0 The hello kitty spoon broke in half.\u00a0 The beauty and the beast spoon I accidentally threw out, and realized this a day too late.\u00a0 I wish I could have rescued my spoon, but the trash truck had come.\u00a0 The scooby doo spoon was lost when I brought it to Asilomar this year (this is the price I pay for bringing my own, delicious peas!).\u00a0 For the ones that broke and I could say a proper goodbye to, I have documented their last days:\n\n[![spoon1](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/spoon1-300x225.jpg)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/spoon1.jpg)\n\nTonight, my flowers spoon met the same fate.\n\n[![FullSizeRender(1)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/FullSizeRender1-225x300.jpg)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/FullSizeRender1.jpg)\n\nI don\u2019t think that this one was very old \u2013 I remember buying it at the Mollie Stones market, having it in my backpack, and showing to my friend Linda on campus.\u00a0 That was probably around my Quals time, which would be late 2013.\u00a0 The typical life-span of these plastic, dishwasher not-safe spoons is usually just a year.\u00a0 Think about the design.\u00a0 It\u2019s plastic only barely fastened to a thin piece of metal, and the attachment is right at the point of force from the human hand.\u00a0 What typically happens is that a small piece of the plastic chips off first, allowing the metal to work as a lever just a little bit more with the force of the hand against the plastic, and then in one swift snap the entire thing cracks.\n\nWhy just one spoon?

If it\u2019s not pleasing to my eye when I look at it, some underlying spiel from the artist isn\u2019t going to suddenly transform the experience of the work for me. Creating something for someone that you care about is fundamentally different than creating something useful for society. Done.\n\nI am conflicted because I love beautiful things. In my everyday life I am distracted by colors, lights, and natural beauty. I want to be at the top of a mountain when the sun rises, or discover patterns in the light peeking through the trees of a forest. Most \u201cart\u201d fails to capture these things for me, and in fact it bothers me when artists create some abstract thing that looks like squiggles and package in in some symbolic mumbo-jumbo that they claim to be profound. For me, \u201cart\u201d is a\u00a0very personal practice of creating things\u00a0that allow for personal expression in the same way as writing, or baking a cake for someone that you love. \u00a0Going to \u201cart school\u201d has never made sense to me, because this personal drive and creativity has to come from within the person. \u00a0Traditional school with grades and other incentives for learning makes sense in the context of obtaining skills\u00a0that are essential for jobs in the traditional workforce. \u00a0If an individual must use art school to support incentive for creating the art, he or she is going to be in trouble when that incentive stream comes to a close. \u00a0Art school is also confusing because it places other artists in the role as \u201cteachers\u201d under some assumption that there is a \u201cright way\u201d to do things, but it\u2019s totally subjective. \u00a0If training in art is desired,\u00a0the motivation must come from within, and when that motivation is present, the individual might naturally seek out other artists for learning and inspiration.\n\nI am not suggesting that art does not have value. \u00a0The practice of creation (or for some), experiencing something that is visually pleasing\u00a0could add richness to an individual\u2019s life, and this is again personal and subjective. \u00a0It may be a shaky foundation to earn a living,\u00a0however, if an individual wants to be an artist, that is a respectable aspiration. \u00a0As I hinted at above, I do not think that\u00a0such an individual would do best\u00a0paying a tuition and going through the conveyor belt that has been defined in academia of doing thesis work, defending, etc. Most \u201cart school\u201d is a waste of time, and someone who is serious about creating things should just skip the formalities and devote every aspect of his or her\u00a0being to doing just that \u2013 practicing, creating, and learning by doing. He should just put his\u00a0money where his\u00a0mouth is and prove that he\u00a0can produce beautiful things, do it better, and attack the feat with unquestionable drive and passion to produce a substantial body of work. He should seek out others to learn from and collaborate with. \u00a0With that level of intense focus he might successfully earn a living. And that will demonstrate that he is\u00a0truly talented at his\u00a0chosen craft so much more than some extension of letters to his\u00a0name.\n\n\n## The \u201cDoers\u201d\n\nThis mindset extends beyond \u201cart\u201d \u2013 there is so much more in proactive \u201cdoing\u201d than spitting out hot air about ideas. The ideas are actually ok, well more than ok \u2013 they are essential \u2013 given that they are interspersed with periods of \u201cdoing.\u201d This \u201cdoing,\u201d whether it be creating something visual, an algorithm, a piece of writing, or an analysis, is essential. I am so inspired by these \u201cdoers.\u201d I am inspired by seeing people that put their heads down and stubbornly pursue building something until it goes to a state of completion. I\u2019m inspired by people that come up with ideas, refine them, and then implement them. When challenge becomes exciting, and learning is craved, you can achieve this unbelievable mindset of not being afraid of failure. I want so badly to follow the lead of these doers, as I am also driven to make things. However, the context of these things having visual elements alongside my skepticism of art is something that I find very ironic. Sometimes I make a thing with the knowledge that it\u2019s probably useless, but was fulfilling for me to make, or useful to learn something. My hope is that if I get good enough, I can master the elements and techniques of visualization to generate tools that add value to scientific discovery. I\u2019m convinced that, if it\u2019s done right, if it\u2019s backed by data and has an actual use for society, then it becomes a completely different animal all together. And if the visual element is not up to par, I can hopefully sleep at night because the accompanying analysis was useful. And if neither of those things were useful, then I need to try again.\n\n\n## A Shift in my Research to Need Visualization\n\nThis drive to produce beautiful visual and meaningful things is a recent development when I realized that so much of data analysis could be aided and improved by simple visualization of the data. Something that is assumed to represent something may be completely off when you actually spend the time to properly visualize it. Something that has immense value that is not properly communicated to the broad scientific community may be entirely lost simply because people cannot see it. So when I realized two things, [1]: I was making assumptions about things in my data based on something trivial (extremely loaded in science is the p-value \u2013 it\u2019s common to plug data into algorithms, get small p-values, and call it a day) and [2]: that I was not good enough to produce the visualizations that would be necessary to see these things, I came to the realization that visualization was essential to add to my toolbox as a researcher. I knew exactly what I wanted to produce, but I didn\u2019t have the skills to make it. That seemed pretty lame. I don\u2019t think an analysis without a meaningful visual communication of the findings will ever be enough for me anymore. I might have just shoved myself between a rock and a hard place, but it seems that there is enough time in life to get better at things.\n\n\n## Standards in Science\n\nIs it a death sentence to set such high standards for work? Does it guarantee erring on the side of perishing? More importantly, could anyone ever really feel OK about pursuing publication of work that does not feel (gut-feeling wise) \u201cgood enough?\u201d I could not. The work that we produce is a reflection of ourselves. I fundamentally believe that as scientists, artists, human beings, we must work so hard to be transparent, honest, and communicate our findings in the most unbiased way that is possible. Visualization can be essential toward this goal. There is also another, dark side that makes me terribly uncomfortable \u2013 the idea that because academic success is rooted in publication, it could be common practice to take some result and try to convince others of its value by inflating it with language. To take something that has not been properly pieced apart, visualized, and understood, and blindly try to convince others that it is sound seems like just another form of hucksterism. I think that good, solid science should almost stand on its own and require minimal additional convincing. In the light of \u201cpublish or perish\u201d some kind of balance must be achieved. There is no way that we can be perfect, but we have to have some standard and just do our best. Learning to achieve this balance is part of graduate school and being a young scientist. We are all trying to figure out how we best fit into this larger academic and knowledge producing beast.\n\n\n## \u201cArt\u201d vs. \u201cSomething Else\u201d\n\nI was moved to write because I recently came across [a talk by Santiago Ortiz](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/113312415) that captured the \u201cart\u201d vs \u201cscientific visualization\u201d dilemma perfectly. He also moved me because of his sheer drive to learn and produce, independently, and under extreme pressure. I will try to summarize his main points:\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not what it is, its where it operates. I want to work with people with real problems\u2026 and be part of the solution\u2026 I don\u2019t want to create experimentalist stuff that ends up being presented as food for thought or inspiration etc. I wanted to work for clients with data\u2026 tools that enable people to explore, identify patterns, etc.\u201d\n\nAnd that hits the nail on the head for me. Meaningful visualizations solve problems. They may not be perfect, but they are backed by data and drive discovery and insight about some human behavior, biology, natural phenomena, etc. It is not enough to be someone that creates visual things, but it can be enough to be someone that creates tools to extend the human ability to understand the world. Santiago is inspiring because he brings to light (what I think) is an understanding that most \u201cartists\u201d choose to leave as an unconscious thought because scrutinizing their work for its true usability would be devastating. It may be impossible, but if in my lifetime I can contribute just one meaningful thing, and immensely enjoy the experience along the way, I think the time spent is worth it. The basis of my learning is informatics, machine learning, and brain imaging \u2013 we can call that the cake. \u00a0The cake is a safety net, and the visualization a bonus, because we always have the cake to fall back on. However, if I can also contribute meaningfully with visualization, that means that I\u2019ve baked a green cake with buttercream frosting, and chocolate bits, and from personal experience, I can attest that it is immensely fulfilling!\n\n\u00a0\n\n[![cake](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/cake.jpg)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/cake.jpg)\n\n\n","html":"<p>For years I&#8217;ve struggled with trying to define (for myself) the difference between &#8220;art,&#8221; and visualizations that (while of course they fit in the domain of art) I find inspiring or meaningful.

More importantly, could anyone ever really feel OK about pursuing publication of work that does not feel (gut-feeling wise) &#8220;good enough?&#8221; I could not. The work that we produce is a reflection of ourselves. I fundamentally believe that as scientists, artists, human beings, we must work so hard to be transparent, honest, and communicate our findings in the most unbiased way that is possible. Visualization can be essential toward this goal. There is also another, dark side that makes me terribly uncomfortable &#8211; the idea that because academic success is rooted in publication, it could be common practice to take some result and try to convince others of its value by inflating it with language. To take something that has not been properly pieced apart, visualized, and understood, and blindly try to convince others that it is sound seems like just another form of hucksterism. I think that good, solid science should almost stand on its own and require minimal additional convincing. In the light of &#8220;publish or perish&#8221; some kind of balance must be achieved. There is no way that we can be perfect, but we have to have some standard and just do our best. Learning to achieve this balance is part of graduate school and being a young scientist. We are all trying to figure out how we best fit into this larger academic and knowledge producing beast.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Art&#8221; vs. &#8220;Something Else&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>I was moved to write because I recently came across <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/113312415\" target=\"_blank\">a talk by Santiago Ortiz<\/a> that captured the &#8220;art&#8221; vs &#8220;scientific visualization&#8221; dilemma perfectly. He also moved me because of his sheer drive to learn and produce, independently, and under extreme pressure. I will try to summarize his main points:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not what it is, its where it operates. I want to work with people with real problems&#8230; and be part of the solution&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to create experimentalist stuff that ends up being presented as food for thought or inspiration etc. I wanted to work for clients with data&#8230; tools that enable people to explore, identify patterns, etc.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And that hits the nail on the head for me. Meaningful visualizations solve problems. They may not be perfect, but they are backed by data and drive discovery and insight about some human behavior, biology, natural phenomena, etc. It is not enough to be someone that creates visual things, but it can be enough to be someone that creates tools to extend the human ability to understand the world. Santiago is inspiring because he brings to light (what I think) is an understanding that most &#8220;artists&#8221; choose to leave as an unconscious thought because scrutinizing their work for its true usability would be devastating. It may be impossible, but if in my lifetime I can contribute just one meaningful thing, and immensely enjoy the experience along the way, I think the time spent is worth it. The basis of my learning is informatics, machine learning, and brain imaging &#8211; we can call that the cake. \u00a0The cake is a safety net, and the visualization a bonus, because we always have the cake to fall back on. However, if I can also contribute meaningfully with visualization, that means that I&#8217;ve baked a green cake with buttercream frosting, and chocolate bits, and from personal experience, I can attest that it is immensely fulfilling!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/cake.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1885\" src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/cake.jpg\" alt=\"cake\" width=\"605\" height=\"535\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 19:55:26 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 19:55:26 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 19:55:26 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1893,"title":"The Velvet Stallion","slug":"the-velvet-stallion","markdown":"\nTangled and fiery, you know his kind  \n Intensity and anguish burns his mind  \n Darkly focused, inexorably lucid  \n Barraging loves, timidly elusive  \n The velvet stallion, charging by day  \n Barraging loves, barrier you away.\n\nA swirling of desire caught in his eye  \n Witty and fickle, but secretly shy  \n A single glance, you enveloped inside  \n A yearning of intense unforgiving stride  \n He dances the mountains, hoping for you  \n He clenches the wind, to hear what to do\n\nA parcel of dream new in his soul  \n Painful and tickle, confusing his goal  \n His passion is nausea, uneasy at best  \n His lucid dream, presenting without rest  \n The unrelenting yearning that brings a scar  \n The trickling wanting, to know where you are\n\nAtop of the world, heart racing with pain  \n The landscape he dominates, whispering a claim  \n It is not lust, sexual, or cognitively clear  \n why he shall never be rested without you near  \n Tamed he will not be, to pause in his stride  \n but to fit into your space, he shall abide.\n\nTentative and cautious, proceed in your course  \n to have captured the spirit of this velveteen horse  \n His moment of clarity, in the quiet of his mind  \n he is infinitely connected to you, your subtle sign  \n A passion so wired, twisty, and deep  \n in his heart forever, you he will keep.\n\n[![horsie](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/horsie.png)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/horsie.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Tangled and fiery, you know his kind<br \/>\nIntensity and anguish burns his mind<br \/>\nDarkly focused, inexorably lucid<br \/>\nBarraging loves, timidly elusive<br \/>\nThe velvet stallion, charging by day<br \/>\nBarraging loves, barrier you away.<\/p>\n<p>A swirling of desire caught in his eye<br \/>\nWitty and fickle, but secretly shy<br \/>\nA single glance, you enveloped inside<br \/>\nA yearning of intense unforgiving stride<br \/>\nHe dances the mountains, hoping for you<br \/>\nHe clenches the wind, to hear what to do<\/p>\n<p>A parcel of dream new in his soul<br \/>\nPainful and tickle, confusing his goal<br \/>\nHis passion is nausea, uneasy at best<br \/>\nHis lucid dream, presenting without rest<br \/>\nThe unrelenting yearning that brings a scar<br \/>\nThe trickling wanting, to know where you are<\/p>\n<p>Atop of the world, heart racing with pain<br \/>\nThe landscape he dominates, whispering a claim<br \/>\nIt is not lust, sexual, or cognitively clear<br \/>\nwhy he shall never be rested without you near<br \/>\nTamed he will not be, to pause in his stride<br \/>\nbut to fit into your space, he shall abide.<\/p>\n<p>Tentative and cautious, proceed in your course<br \/>\nto have captured the spirit of this velveteen horse<br \/>\nHis moment of clarity, in the quiet of his mind<br \/>\nhe is infinitely connected to you, your subtle sign<br \/>\nA passion so wired, twisty, and deep<br \/>\nin his heart forever, you he will keep.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/horsie.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1894\" src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/horsie.png\" alt=\"horsie\" width=\"394\" height=\"531\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/horsie.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 17:35:31 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 17:35:50 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 17:35:31 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1899,"title":"Visual explanation of coordinate-based meta-analysis approaches","slug":"visual-explanation-of-coordinate-based-meta-analysis-approaches","markdown":"\nNeuroscientists need to understand their results in the context of previous literature.

It was called [Stumbling on Happiness](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/2007\/08\/stumbling-on-happiness\/), and almost eight years ago, I started reading it at my home in New Hampshire. I was terribly unhappy. I had gone through a highly painful and prolonged surgery at the end of the previous school year that, even after being released from the hospital after many weeks, left me with tubes coming out of my abdomen hooked up to a machine that I had to carry around in a black bag. Whomever made those tubes clearly was either just being practical, or had no empathy for a college student that would have to place the machine front and center on a desk in front of 160 other students. I also had experienced heartbreak, unfortunately at the exact same time, and that is on top of the normal introspective questioning about purpose, worth, and interacting with other people that is the albatross to any college-aged human. That was just the end of the school year. I launched right into a full time summer internship, which was physiologically stressful in that I made a 2-3 hour commute (one way) from New Hampshire to Boston each day. In a potpourri of transportation methods, it included driving, bus riding, walking, and sometimes a spurious trip on the T mostly because I like being in\u00a0tunnels. However, the bus was my favorite because it was quiet and soft. I used to curl my knees up to my chest, plug headphones into the free music outlet, and quietly cry. This act, although embarrassing in most situations, is a well-needed release for emotion when there is no other cabinet to lock it into. Still, I did not show this to anyone, because to be so weak was so shameful. By the end of it all, specifically when it was time to return to school for another round, I went and came back. I had no drive to think hard about seemingly unimportant classwork because nothing was certain. I had always been a machine, and I was defined by strength and being able to survive things that are unexpected. But my foundation of certainty was about as substantial as bonito flakes. It would blow away whenever anyone sneezed.\n\nI was laying on the floor of my room on a purple flowered rug that made me feel itchy, and despite the highly introverted nature of my family leading us to all be in our own sections of the house anyway, I had the door tightly shut. My room in our farm was over the section of the house without heat, away from the core of warmth from our wood stove, so it was always freezing. Since I was in college we had moved away from the house where we lived in high school, and I missed the soft carpet in my old room, and the warmth of the house. I\u2019ve always been a floor worker, and a monkey in chairs, so I was appropriately sprawled out reading a book. In front of me was my Dell, my faithful companion, who currently had the World of Warcraft login screen open, showing my character, Sinotopia, standing at attention with a small movement every now and then to adjust a hand, wiggle a leg, or be convincing that she wasn\u2019t actually a repeating animation sequence. [![sino](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/sino-150x150.jpg)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/sino.jpg)It was deep in the middle of the night, because I didn\u2019t sleep so much, and I had just finished playing for many hours, and as I always did, I logged out and realized that the momentary distraction, the pixels that try to convince of meaningful interaction and accomplishment, did not serve to fill the emptiness that came to awareness after. It was my strategy to avoid spending quality time with myself, because I tend to think very critically about things, and go through a depth of introspection that is akin to diving shoulder-deep into the impressive pails that are hidden in the waist-high freezers at the ice cream shop where I worked in high school. I think about things a lot because I\u2019m rather stupid. I can only understand things to any degree of satisfaction and reproducibility after tearing them into the tiniest of pieces, and then putting those pieces back together again. While getting the last scoop of ice cream would be desirable, this mental diving effort was something to be avoided. For this reason I had avoided (and still do, to some degree), extensive reading of things, or partaking in anything that wasn\u2019t a straight forward, logical task. Anything other than enjoyable building or production of something, my brain would gobble up, and prompt introspection that was exhausting. It always (and still does) prompt me to write, because I have to put it somewhere to get rid of it. I was, possibly foolishly, reading Stumbling on Happiness. [![stumbling](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/stumbling-150x150.jpg)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/stumbling.jpg)Yes, it\u2019s no different right now, I went back to revisit that book. At the time I think that I was hoping that it would stumble me in the right direction, which appropriately, it seemed to do.\n\nIt is typical for us to perceive experience, and color our experience based on context. The book\u2019s charging message is that human beings are terrible at thinking about the future, specifically, we are hard-wired to be irrationally optimistic and be completely wrong about the things that will make us happy. Most of the book is filled with clever puns and an extensive reporting of every niche psychology study, ones that you could only imagine ways for how they got funding. At the time, I was overwhelmed with the realization that I didn\u2019t know myself at all. I was no longer a competitive runner, something that had defined me for many years, I wasn\u2019t particularly good at anything, and I was one of those unfortunate undergraduates majoring in computer games with a sampling of primarily useless Psychology courses on the side. I didn\u2019t have many deep friendships because getting close to people meant vulnerability and being social was hard, and I was convinced of being the girl that could disappear and no one would (save possibly my parents) really notice. It\u2019s a dangerous mental state, but I would suspect a common one, for the 20 year old with frontal lobes still developing. Although I was soaking in a marinade of computer games and self-loathing, what had always been my core, an embedded sense of logic and proactive decision making, was still with me. If I was unhappy, I just needed to figure out what would make me happy, and then do it. I needed time to think, and I knew that it wouldn\u2019t happen if I felt trapped at a farm. I had always found inspiration from things that are beautiful, from movement, and from music, and so I decided to pursue those things. At approximately 5 in the morning in early September, I packed a small backpack with a cell phone, credit card, a Garmin navigation device, and one change of clothes, and decided to go for a really long run.\n\nMy plan was to go generally West, and I would use this time to think. This was the ultimate committment device, and relief from the situation of being trapped in a farm and the burden on my parents of dealing with my ornery self. I ran and walked for most of the first day, and by the evening I had covered over 40 miles, going from Weare to Keene, NH, and ending up at a hotel in some shopping center. My feet were bleeding. This was not something that I had expected. Matter of fact, [I took a picture](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/feet.jpg), if you can stomach it. \u00a0It was then time to call my parents. I had decided to create some distance between us, because there was no way they would approve of this journey of mine. They still didn\u2019t, but they have always approached raising my brother and I with an eternal provision of economic and functional support. They drove the distance (much faster than my much slower method) and they brought me my Brother\u2019s old bike. I would bike for the remainder of the trip, with a short joy run in the morning to keep both muscle groups functioning properly.\n\nStumbling on Happiness changed my life because it prompted a journey from New Hampshire to Ohio, across tiny mountains that I wasn\u2019t even aware of existing, and all the while asking myself a lot of hard questions that truly could only be addressed in the presence of rolling roadways, and the embrace of the wind. [![summit](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/summit-150x150.jpg)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/summit.jpg)I sometimes slept in actual hotels that surprisingly would offer immensely wonderful free food, cheap rooms, and encouragement, sometimes ad-hoc camp grounds, and one night was even privy to be in the same establishment of cabins as some kind of biker gang that did know how to have fun after the sun went down. The exhausting physical effort in the day, and sheer appreciation for things like warm showers gave me much needed [moments of serenity and calm](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/relief.jpg). I always woke up with the dawn, would put on my \u201cother\u201d change of clothes, and get back at it, namely, pedaling and thinking. After just under 1000 miles, going from New Hampshire through the majority of Ohio, I had regained my foundation of decision, meaning a set of proactive steps to take, a strategy, for resolving this current issue. I was resolved that my stubbornness had served me well before, and would do again, because it meant that I would never give up. I realized that It was acceptable to not have the answers, and to be stupid and lost, as long as there was a plan for moving forward. I had to also come to the acceptance that a chain of bad things had happened to me since I left high school, that it was unfortunate, that it had changed me irrevocably, and that I did not want to be defined by it. I also realized that the underlying sadness was prompted by an inability to foster any kind of control over my relationships, my future, or my incentive structure. However, control over those things is also (largely) an unrealistic thing to strive for. Rather, re-establishing happiness would likely involve re-building confidence, and a sense of control in having understanding of the tiny bits of experience that bring joy, and equivalently, stress and sadness. It was really a very selfish way of thinking, but mindless achievement followed by listless floor dwelling was simply not an option. What were those little things, and could I learn to incorporate more of the good bits into my life, and avoid the bad ones? It occurred to me that, while on the surface this goal was very selfish, I would be most useful and positively impact others given that I had a strong sense of self and purpose. I decided that the only way to figure out the things that would give me larger purpose was to dip my toe into many streams, and travel down many new roads. [![road](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/road-150x150.jpg)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/road.jpg)I needed to try absolutely everything, and this filled me with a new sense of purpose and excitement. My appetite for risk was enhanced, and it retrospectively dawned on me that one of the hardest things in life, change, can sometimes only be spurred by an ability to embrace such risk. Further, uncertainty that may be deemed as risk at one point in life may completely lose the label when one has not much to lose. but much to gain.\n\nAs quickly as I had left for the journey, I knew when it was over, and I was ready to go home. I found a local bike shop in a town I was passing through, a kid not much older than myself who put my bike in a box into the mail, and drove me to a tiny airport, asking nothing more than a $10 bill. I returned home just in time for my birthday, and my Dad, who was coming home from a long shift, brought me a blueberry muffin that we appropriately put a candle into. [![21](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/21-150x150.jpg)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/21.jpg)On my 17th birthday, I was forced to grow up very quickly, and go through mental processes that likely don\u2019t spawn into the end of the third decade of life. Although I was an old soul, my sense of self was not matched to that age. On my 21st birthday, as if both of us had been wandering the landscape for years, we drove up the same intersection, and were reunited.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n### The Story of Stumbling: Coming Full Circle\n\nIt is now almost 8 years later, and while I take precautions to not return to things that bring subtle aches of memory, I realize that I need to come full circle in this Story of Stumbling. Reading some of this book for a second time has led to me thinking about the following points. The funny thing about these introspections is that I have seen many of these themes before, possibly hinting that I am rather slow at coming to resolutions, or limited in my own thinking capacity.\n\n#### Emotional memory returns when prompted\n\nIn reading the pages of Stumbling on Happiness again, I was first overtaken with memory. There are aches of remembrance that I would much prefer to not feel again, and largely, I can control not feeling such aches by avoiding the experiences that cause them.\n\n#### We vary in the degree to which we think about the future\n\nI was next aware of a very basic assumption that the author was making \u2013 that people tend to think (or dream up) little fantasies of the future simply for pure enjoyment. This can be as simple as looking forward to a birthday party, seeing family, or having the weekend off. I know that I used to do that a lot, because I remember planning little parties, looking forward to showing a movie in Spanish class, or coming home for Christmas. I am very sensitive when I have epiphanies of being different, or possibly broken, and this realization made me feel that twinge. I think a lot about the present, most definitely the past to remember things that were enjoyable or funny, and while I cannot answer why I don\u2019t fantasize about the future, I can say that it\u2019s very infrequent. It does well to explain my fairly limited incentive structure to always be wanting to do things in the moment that give momentary fulfillment and purpose, and my traditional answer to \u201ckeep doing what I am doing now,\u201d when asked about plans for the future. And so, I have come to realize that like most personality traits, people must differ in the degree to which they think about the future. I don\u2019t have a sense for this distribution of people \u2013 it could be the case that chronically depressed dwell in the past (and are not privy to having the common irrational but evolutionarily advantageous optimistic life bias), and overly self-assured and economically gifted individuals live for dreaming up future scenarios to the point they assume themselves already there and have a very low tolerance for hard work or adversity. I just don\u2019t know.\n\n#### Context drives interpretation\n\nI was next aware of the importance of context to drive interpretation. My first reading resulted in the thought \u201cI have no idea about the experiences (functional, daily things) that give me meaning,\u201d and for this second reading, the thought has changed to \u201cI have no idea about the people (interactions) that give me meaning.\u201d It\u2019s easy to follow scripts based on previous social interactions to know what to do at a dinner outing, or an office meeting, but following such scripts is merely a strategy for being a functioning human, and says nothing about the good-feelingness (or bad-feelingness) that may come from the interaction. Arguably, if we make the assumption that humans are monogomous, long-term relationship desiring beings, we would strive to find relationships with others that maximize some benefit of each person to the other(s) life. It could be functional, emotional, physical, financial, or more realistically, some combination of those things. Eight years ago I was overwhelmed with needing to understand meaning in the context of myself, and now I am wanting to understand my meaning in the context of others.\n\n#### We need one another\n\nOne of the deepest insecurities that can reside in a human soul is the fear of not having anything to add to anyone else\u2019s life. Deep down, we all want to be needed and valued, by someone, for something, and possibly have some mental comfort that the strength of that need is substantial enough so that there is some certainty that it will endure. For even the tiniest thing, like taking head of the ship to bring someone else a coffee, being relied upon by a friend to bring a cherished snack, can well us up with happiness like bloated raisins. In fact, people like one another more when they ask for favors, but this stands in opposition to the common fear of inconveniencing people by asking for things. Asking for raisins, coffee, emotional support, or help is also context dependent. If an individual values another individual, the bond is strengthened. If the value is not yet established, the person is annoying, needy, and leads to the second individual not liking the person. This second situation is terrifying, and means that it is more risk averse to not ask for things. It\u2019s also hard to ask for help because asking for help means being vulnerable. When we see things about ourselves that we do not like so much, given that we don\u2019t like ourselves for having such things, it is only logical that others won\u2019t either. On the other hand, knowing about others\u2019 imperfections (counter-intuitively)\u00a0makes us feel closer to them. The perception of an \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cgenerally normal\u201d person is just that, a perception. \u00a0Most people come from interesting life experiences, are survivors, and\/or feel insecure about things, and the only true difference is the degree to which that information is revealed. \u00a0For an individual with perfectionistic tendencies, the state I would call \u201cself-loathing\u201d comes strongly to mind. In absence of external support, that negative state is projected directly inward, and the\u00a0projection of the underlying belief that led to the loathing onto others\u00a0further prevents revealing such vulnerabilities to obtain support. This leads to an individual taking on the complete burden of their own insecurities, and what I would call existence at a distance. In this situation it is\u00a0impossible to establish relationships where a duality of back and forth needing can be fostered, and thus the\u00a0human desire for need is not fulfilled.\n\n#### Choice paralyzes, and hinders connecting with others\n\nTo connect with others, it is essential to have some sense of self-worth. This is hindered because there is a tendency to immediately compare ourselves to some template or ideal, become aware of the enormous amount of choice that others have when choosing relationships, friendships, and conclude that it is minimally unlikely to be chosen over others. Even if we were to make the top of a list, it\u2019s even more likely that people are terrible at allocating time, or even taking small actions to demonstrate to others that they value one another. To speak from personal experience, over the years I of course have had that insecurity, and while again there is no control over allocating others\u2019 values, I have tried to make an effort to commit to things I know that I can make time for, and show value in the limited number of ways that I know how, which usually means being physically present, or giving presents (on a side note, nothing gives greater joy than presents, although ironically receiving them usually results in feeling badly that some amount of money or energy was spent).\n\nGiven that we are paralyzed by\u00a0making choices, how do people connect with one another? What makes most sense to me is that people will naturally find one another when they like to do the same things (Oh, look, I choose to do X in my daily life, and you do too, we can do activity X together), when they also have affection for one another (Oh, you fell off your bike? I have this deep and confusing desire to take care of you), and when they don\u2019t mind the other\u2019s presence (Oh, it\u2019s 9pm on a Tuesday night, yes I\u2019m OK that you are breathing in the same space as me, and you will be occupying valuable blanket area in the same bed in about 20 minutes). It seems to me (and is unfortunate) that *many*\u00a0relationships (whether romantic or friendship), get started based on convenience (or for just romantic, physical infatuation) and then the only logical result is that the individuals get bored of one another. Let\u2019s be honest, even in \u201cgood\u201d relationships this is highly likely to happen. It\u2019s a terrible outcome because it really hurts to have this happen, and can negatively impact other wonderful things in daily life for many years. So, maintaining superficial relationships is a much safer strategy. But that means that we would be incapable of connecting with one another. What gives?\n\nBeing human probably means that we must try our hardest to connect, to be vulnerable, and know that any any moment it can all come crashing down. Reading some of these passages a second time, I am again\u00a0thinking\u00a0about my basic beliefs and the action\u00a0that results (or doesn\u2019t result) from them. As I get older, it occurs to me that there are times when I don\u2019t want to have to be so strong. There are times when I really just want the biggest of hugs, or another human to have awareness of me needing support, even possibly when I do or cannot express it. On the flip side, an even deeper desire is to be the one that can give the support. \u00a0What many of us ask, is that\u00a0beyond friendships of convenience (like single serving airplane friends that will end when the flight is over) could there exist another person (robot?) that we\u00a0might stumble into, and give insight to answering this question about what components of interaction provide deeper meaning? I suspect the answer to that question will be different for each person. I also suspect that answering it will require more risk taking and sheer luck, and finally having an answer will coincide with\u00a0growing into a new level of\u00a0interpersonal maturity.\n\n#### The\u00a0best strategy is probably maintaining openness to experience\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer to this question, and I\u2019m not even sure how to figure it out. It\u2019s pretty easy to address when introspection is involved. During my epic bike journey I thought over many experiences, and came to some basic conclusions that I needed to experience more things. In the case of people, other than going to a substantial number of social things, throwing away insecurity about talking to random people encountered in daily life, and in a romantic sense, going on an occasional date, there is no good way to \u201cexperience people.\u201d Actually, the more salient factor here is control. With a search for meaning in the self, there is complete control over choosing experiences, deciding if they are liked, and then doing them. With people, even if the perfect other individual could be identified for a friend, housemate, or special life companion, there is no way to ensure that the liking would be mutual. It\u2019s highly likely that it wouldn\u2019t be. Most of the time some external life circumstances force interaction of people with one another, and further chance life circumstances, namely experiencing something that a second person also experiences, establishes special closeness. That makes it an even more impossible problem. Further, the common fear of vulnerability, tendency to not take risks, and easiness to let indecision guide decision (maintaining the status quot) means that answering this question has a large component that is chance. This subtly implies that there is no ideal strategy other than being open to experience, focusing on what gives meaning in the present, and letting probability do its thing. A third complicating factor is having an incentive structure that is not predictably average, and I am thinking of myself in this case. The first round of this \u201cstumbling on happiness\u201d introspection worked *so* well that I identified the little bits of things that gave me meaning, and now I find it hard to do anything else.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nI again have many questions and not a lot of good answers. Ironically, I read about 2\/3 of this book, got bored with the endless citations of \u201csurprising\u201d research, and still have not finished it. I suspect I will give it another try in 8 years! The problem is that, if we can break people into two groups: those that consume things, and those that produce them, my capacity for production of things far out-sprints my capacity to consume them. I don\u2019t know how this is distributed in a normal population, but I\u2019d guess given American culture that most are more heavy on the consumer side. In graduate school I have absorbed the belief that to be successful, I must err on the side of consumption with careful, targeted production. Thus, I live in constant angst that I am off balance, and try my every effort to resolve the weakness. \u00a0But it could be the case that being highly proficient in both (living in autarky) is an inefficient strategy, and that the ideal collaboration would involve specialization, meaning the pairing of a consumer and a producer. The consumer would absorb all of the knowledge and need that is currently represented, and communicate what is missing to the producer, who would then fulfill the need. It\u2019s a lot harder to ask good questions than to generate an algorithm or tool to answer them. I do need to find a good consumer, because I\u2019m sure there are answers out there to some of my questions if internal drive to produce could be slowed down in favor of consumption. Perhaps I can only conclude that reading might be highly dangerous for me, because it results in something longer than the pages themselves.\n\nOn a more serious note, looking back on this experience,\u00a0a proper conclusion to this 8 year introspection must include an evaluation.\u00a0While sometimes it feels like it would be less of a burden to have the emotional depth of a goldfish, I find value in the possibility of being able to introspect, and instill change. \u00a0While these early experiences\u00a0(possibly) eliminated my capacity for deriving enjoyment from thinking about the future, they did alter my focus to direct, immediate actions and feelings, and over time that has instilled in me an almost stupid naivety and ability to derive joy from such trivial things. I plan my future in a way to maximize these momentary pleasures, which means avoiding airports, sitting in traffic, and post-office lines. It\u2019s also lead to a (so far) bottomless well of motivation and drive that lacks any clear explanation for\u00a0existing at all. When self-doubt and obstacles knock, while there may be a time when the turkeys get me down, a strength comes forth that transforms frustration into empowerment, and I try again.\n\nOne thing I am sure of, is that there are only about 3 hours left before I must bike home in the evening, and I really want to do some lovely producing! I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll stumble into interpersonal meaning, but for now I\u2019m going to stumble back into syntax colored gedit where I like to be ![:)](http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/simple-smile.png)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Almost eight years ago, the director of a group in a company where I worked gave me a book that changed my life. It was called <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/2007\/08\/stumbling-on-happiness\/\" target=\"_blank\">Stumbling on Happiness<\/a>, and almost eight years ago, I started reading it at my home in New Hampshire. I was terribly unhappy. I had gone through a highly painful and prolonged surgery at the end of the previous school year that, even after being released from the hospital after many weeks, left me with tubes coming out of my abdomen hooked up to a machine that I had to carry around in a black bag. Whomever made those tubes clearly was either just being practical, or had no empathy for a college student that would have to place the machine front and center on a desk in front of 160 other students. I also had experienced heartbreak, unfortunately at the exact same time, and that is on top of the normal introspective questioning about purpose, worth, and interacting with other people that is the albatross to any college-aged human. That was just the end of the school year. I launched right into a full time summer internship, which was physiologically stressful in that I made a 2-3 hour commute (one way) from New Hampshire to Boston each day. In a potpourri of transportation methods, it included driving, bus riding, walking, and sometimes a spurious trip on the T mostly because I like being in\u00a0tunnels. However, the bus was my favorite because it was quiet and soft. I used to curl my knees up to my chest, plug headphones into the free music outlet, and quietly cry. This act, although embarrassing in most situations, is a well-needed release for emotion when there is no other cabinet to lock it into. Still, I did not show this to anyone, because to be so weak was so shameful. By the end of it all, specifically when it was time to return to school for another round, I went and came back. I had no drive to think hard about seemingly unimportant classwork because nothing was certain. I had always been a machine, and I was defined by strength and being able to survive things that are unexpected. But my foundation of certainty was about as substantial as bonito flakes. It would blow away whenever anyone sneezed.<\/p>\n<p>I was laying on the floor of my room on a purple flowered rug that made me feel itchy, and despite the highly introverted nature of my family leading us to all be in our own sections of the house anyway, I had the door tightly shut. My room in our farm was over the section of the house without heat, away from the core of warmth from our wood stove, so it was always freezing. Since I was in college we had moved away from the house where we lived in high school, and I missed the soft carpet in my old room, and the warmth of the house. I&#8217;ve always been a floor worker, and a monkey in chairs, so I was appropriately sprawled out reading a book. In front of me was my Dell, my faithful companion, who currently had the World of Warcraft login screen open, showing my character, Sinotopia, standing at attention with a small movement every now and then to adjust a hand, wiggle a leg, or be convincing that she wasn&#8217;t actually a repeating animation sequence. <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/sino.jpg\"><img class=\" size-thumbnail wp-image-1944 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/sino-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"sino\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>It was deep in the middle of the night, because I didn&#8217;t sleep so much, and I had just finished playing for many hours, and as I always did, I logged out and realized that the momentary distraction, the pixels that try to convince of meaningful interaction and accomplishment, did not serve to fill the emptiness that came to awareness after. It was my strategy to avoid spending quality time with myself, because I tend to think very critically about things, and go through a depth of introspection that is akin to diving shoulder-deep into the impressive pails that are hidden in the waist-high freezers at the ice cream shop where I worked in high school. I think about things a lot because I&#8217;m rather stupid. I can only understand things to any degree of satisfaction and reproducibility after tearing them into the tiniest of pieces, and then putting those pieces back together again. While getting the last scoop of ice cream would be desirable, this mental diving effort was something to be avoided. For this reason I had avoided (and still do, to some degree), extensive reading of things, or partaking in anything that wasn&#8217;t a straight forward, logical task. Anything other than enjoyable building or production of something, my brain would gobble up, and prompt introspection that was exhausting. It always (and still does) prompt me to write, because I have to put it somewhere to get rid of it. I was, possibly foolishly, reading Stumbling on Happiness. <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/stumbling.jpg\"><img class=\" size-thumbnail wp-image-1945 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/stumbling-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"stumbling\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>Yes, it&#8217;s no different right now, I went back to revisit that book. At the time I think that I was hoping that it would stumble me in the right direction, which appropriately, it seemed to do.<\/p>\n<p>It is typical for us to perceive experience, and color our experience based on context. The book&#8217;s charging message is that human beings are terrible at thinking about the future, specifically, we are hard-wired to be irrationally optimistic and be completely wrong about the things that will make us happy. Most of the book is filled with clever puns and an extensive reporting of every niche psychology study, ones that you could only imagine ways for how they got funding. At the time, I was overwhelmed with the realization that I didn&#8217;t know myself at all. I was no longer a competitive runner, something that had defined me for many years, I wasn&#8217;t particularly good at anything, and I was one of those unfortunate undergraduates majoring in computer games with a sampling of primarily useless Psychology courses on the side. I didn&#8217;t have many deep friendships because getting close to people meant vulnerability and being social was hard, and I was convinced of being the girl that could disappear and no one would (save possibly my parents) really notice. It&#8217;s a dangerous mental state, but I would suspect a common one, for the 20 year old with frontal lobes still developing. Although I was soaking in a marinade of computer games and self-loathing, what had always been my core, an embedded sense of logic and proactive decision making, was still with me. If I was unhappy, I just needed to figure out what would make me happy, and then do it. I needed time to think, and I knew that it wouldn&#8217;t happen if I felt trapped at a farm. I had always found inspiration from things that are beautiful, from movement, and from music, and so I decided to pursue those things. At approximately 5 in the morning in early September, I packed a small backpack with a cell phone, credit card, a Garmin navigation device, and one change of clothes, and decided to go for a really long run.<\/p>\n<p>My plan was to go generally West, and I would use this time to think. This was the ultimate committment device, and relief from the situation of being trapped in a farm and the burden on my parents of dealing with my ornery self. I ran and walked for most of the first day, and by the evening I had covered over 40 miles, going from Weare to Keene, NH, and ending up at a hotel in some shopping center. My feet were bleeding. This was not something that I had expected. Matter of fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/feet.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">I took a picture<\/a>, if you can stomach it. \u00a0It was then time to call my parents. I had decided to create some distance between us, because there was no way they would approve of this journey of mine. They still didn&#8217;t, but they have always approached raising my brother and I with an eternal provision of economic and functional support. They drove the distance (much faster than my much slower method) and they brought me my Brother&#8217;s old bike. I would bike for the remainder of the trip, with a short joy run in the morning to keep both muscle groups functioning properly.<\/p>\n<p>Stumbling on Happiness changed my life because it prompted a journey from New Hampshire to Ohio, across tiny mountains that I wasn&#8217;t even aware of existing, and all the while asking myself a lot of hard questions that truly could only be addressed in the presence of rolling roadways, and the embrace of the wind. <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/summit.jpg\"><img class=\" size-thumbnail wp-image-1947 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/summit-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"summit\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>I sometimes slept in actual hotels that surprisingly would offer immensely wonderful free food, cheap rooms, and encouragement, sometimes ad-hoc camp grounds, and one night was even privy to be in the same establishment of cabins as some kind of biker gang that did know how to have fun after the sun went down. The exhausting physical effort in the day, and sheer appreciation for things like warm showers gave me much needed <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/relief.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">moments of serenity and calm<\/a>. I always woke up with the dawn, would put on my &#8220;other&#8221; change of clothes, and get back at it, namely, pedaling and thinking. After just under 1000 miles, going from New Hampshire through the majority of Ohio, I had regained my foundation of decision, meaning a set of proactive steps to take, a strategy, for resolving this current issue. I was resolved that my stubbornness had served me well before, and would do again, because it meant that I would never give up. I realized that It was acceptable to not have the answers, and to be stupid and lost, as long as there was a plan for moving forward. I had to also come to the acceptance that a chain of bad things had happened to me since I left high school, that it was unfortunate, that it had changed me irrevocably, and that I did not want to be defined by it. I also realized that the underlying sadness was prompted by an inability to foster any kind of control over my relationships, my future, or my incentive structure. However, control over those things is also (largely) an unrealistic thing to strive for. Rather, re-establishing happiness would likely involve re-building confidence, and a sense of control in having understanding of the tiny bits of experience that bring joy, and equivalently, stress and sadness. It was really a very selfish way of thinking, but mindless achievement followed by listless floor dwelling was simply not an option. What were those little things, and could I learn to incorporate more of the good bits into my life, and avoid the bad ones? It occurred to me that, while on the surface this goal was very selfish, I would be most useful and positively impact others given that I had a strong sense of self and purpose. I decided that the only way to figure out the things that would give me larger purpose was to dip my toe into many streams, and travel down many new roads. <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/road.jpg\"><img class=\" size-thumbnail wp-image-1949 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/road-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"road\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>I needed to try absolutely everything, and this filled me with a new sense of purpose and excitement. My appetite for risk was enhanced, and it retrospectively dawned on me that one of the hardest things in life, change, can sometimes only be spurred by an ability to embrace such risk. Further, uncertainty that may be deemed as risk at one point in life may completely lose the label when one has not much to lose. but much to gain.<\/p>\n<p>As quickly as I had left for the journey, I knew when it was over, and I was ready to go home. I found a local bike shop in a town I was passing through, a kid not much older than myself who put my bike in a box into the mail, and drove me to a tiny airport, asking nothing more than a $10 bill. I returned home just in time for my birthday, and my Dad, who was coming home from a long shift, brought me a blueberry muffin that we appropriately put a candle into. <a href=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/21.jpg\"><img class=\" size-thumbnail wp-image-1950 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/vsoch.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/21-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"21\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>On my 17th birthday, I was forced to grow up very quickly, and go through mental processes that likely don&#8217;t spawn into the end of the third decade of life. Although I was an old soul, my sense of self was not matched to that age. On my 21st birthday, as if both of us had been wandering the landscape for years, we drove up the same intersection, and were reunited.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>The Story of Stumbling: Coming Full Circle<\/h3>\n<p>It is now almost 8 years later, and while I take precautions to not return to things that bring subtle aches of memory, I realize that I need to come full circle in this Story of Stumbling. Reading some of this book for a second time has led to me thinking about the following points. The funny thing about these introspections is that I have seen many of these themes before, possibly hinting that I am rather slow at coming to resolutions, or limited in my own thinking capacity.<\/p>\n<h4>Emotional memory returns when prompted<\/h4>\n<p>In reading the pages of Stumbling on Happiness again, I was first overtaken with memory. There are aches of remembrance that I would much prefer to not feel again, and largely, I can control not feeling such aches by avoiding the experiences that cause them.<\/p>\n<h4>We vary in the degree to which we think about the future<\/h4>\n<p>I was next aware of a very basic assumption that the author was making &#8211; that people tend to think (or dream up) little fantasies of the future simply for pure enjoyment. This can be as simple as looking forward to a birthday party, seeing family, or having the weekend off. I know that I used to do that a lot, because I remember planning little parties, looking forward to showing a movie in Spanish class, or coming home for Christmas. I am very sensitive when I have epiphanies of being different, or possibly broken, and this realization made me feel that twinge. I think a lot about the present, most definitely the past to remember things that were enjoyable or funny, and while I cannot answer why I don&#8217;t fantasize about the future, I can say that it&#8217;s very infrequent. It does well to explain my fairly limited incentive structure to always be wanting to do things in the moment that give momentary fulfillment and purpose, and my traditional answer to &#8220;keep doing what I am doing now,&#8221; when asked about plans for the future. And so, I have come to realize that like most personality traits, people must differ in the degree to which they think about the future. I don&#8217;t have a sense for this distribution of people &#8211; it could be the case that chronically depressed dwell in the past (and are not privy to having the common irrational but evolutionarily advantageous optimistic life bias), and overly self-assured and economically gifted individuals live for dreaming up future scenarios to the point they assume themselves already there and have a very low tolerance for hard work or adversity. I just don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<h4>Context drives interpretation<\/h4>\n<p>I was next aware of the importance of context to drive interpretation. My first reading resulted in the thought &#8220;I have no idea about the experiences (functional, daily things) that give me meaning,&#8221; and for this second reading, the thought has changed to &#8220;I have no idea about the people (interactions) that give me meaning.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to follow scripts based on previous social interactions to know what to do at a dinner outing, or an office meeting, but following such scripts is merely a strategy for being a functioning human, and says nothing about the good-feelingness (or bad-feelingness) that may come from the interaction. Arguably, if we make the assumption that humans are monogomous, long-term relationship desiring beings, we would strive to find relationships with others that maximize some benefit of each person to the other(s) life. It could be functional, emotional, physical, financial, or more realistically, some combination of those things. Eight years ago I was overwhelmed with needing to understand meaning in the context of myself, and now I am wanting to understand my meaning in the context of others.<\/p>\n<h4>We need one another<\/h4>\n<p>One of the deepest insecurities that can reside in a human soul is the fear of not having anything to add to anyone else&#8217;s life. Deep down, we all want to be needed and valued, by someone, for something, and possibly have some mental comfort that the strength of that need is substantial enough so that there is some certainty that it will endure. For even the tiniest thing, like taking head of the ship to bring someone else a coffee, being relied upon by a friend to bring a cherished snack, can well us up with happiness like bloated raisins. In fact, people like one another more when they ask for favors, but this stands in opposition to the common fear of inconveniencing people by asking for things. Asking for raisins, coffee, emotional support, or help is also context dependent. If an individual values another individual, the bond is strengthened. If the value is not yet established, the person is annoying, needy, and leads to the second individual not liking the person. This second situation is terrifying, and means that it is more risk averse to not ask for things. It&#8217;s also hard to ask for help because asking for help means being vulnerable. When we see things about ourselves that we do not like so much, given that we don&#8217;t like ourselves for having such things, it is only logical that others won&#8217;t either. On the other hand, knowing about others&#8217; imperfections (counter-intuitively)\u00a0makes us feel closer to them. The perception of an &#8220;average&#8221; or &#8220;generally normal&#8221; person is just that, a perception. \u00a0Most people come from interesting life experiences, are survivors, and\/or feel insecure about things, and the only true difference is the degree to which that information is revealed. \u00a0For an individual with perfectionistic tendencies, the state I would call &#8220;self-loathing&#8221; comes strongly to mind. In absence of external support, that negative state is projected directly inward, and the\u00a0projection of the underlying belief that led to the loathing onto others\u00a0further prevents revealing such vulnerabilities to obtain support. This leads to an individual taking on the complete burden of their own insecurities, and what I would call existence at a distance. In this situation it is\u00a0impossible to establish relationships where a duality of back and forth needing can be fostered, and thus the\u00a0human desire for need is not fulfilled.<\/p>\n<h4>Choice paralyzes, and hinders connecting with others<\/h4>\n<p>To connect with others, it is essential to have some sense of self-worth. This is hindered because there is a tendency to immediately compare ourselves to some template or ideal, become aware of the enormous amount of choice that others have when choosing relationships, friendships, and conclude that it is minimally unlikely to be chosen over others. Even if we were to make the top of a list, it&#8217;s even more likely that people are terrible at allocating time, or even taking small actions to demonstrate to others that they value one another. To speak from personal experience, over the years I of course have had that insecurity, and while again there is no control over allocating others&#8217; values, I have tried to make an effort to commit to things I know that I can make time for, and show value in the limited number of ways that I know how, which usually means being physically present, or giving presents (on a side note, nothing gives greater joy than presents, although ironically receiving them usually results in feeling badly that some amount of money or energy was spent).<\/p>\n<p>Given that we are paralyzed by\u00a0making choices, how do people connect with one another? What makes most sense to me is that people will naturally find one another when they like to do the same things (Oh, look, I choose to do X in my daily life, and you do too, we can do activity X together), when they also have affection for one another (Oh, you fell off your bike? I have this deep and confusing desire to take care of you), and when they don&#8217;t mind the other&#8217;s presence (Oh, it&#8217;s 9pm on a Tuesday night, yes I&#8217;m OK that you are breathing in the same space as me, and you will be occupying valuable blanket area in the same bed in about 20 minutes). It seems to me (and is unfortunate) that <em>many<\/em>\u00a0relationships (whether romantic or friendship), get started based on convenience (or for just romantic, physical infatuation) and then the only logical result is that the individuals get bored of one another. Let&#8217;s be honest, even in &#8220;good&#8221; relationships this is highly likely to happen. It&#8217;s a terrible outcome because it really hurts to have this happen, and can negatively impact other wonderful things in daily life for many years. So, maintaining superficial relationships is a much safer strategy. But that means that we would be incapable of connecting with one another. What gives?<\/p>\n<p>Being human probably means that we must try our hardest to connect, to be vulnerable, and know that any any moment it can all come crashing down. Reading some of these passages a second time, I am again\u00a0thinking\u00a0about my basic beliefs and the action\u00a0that results (or doesn&#8217;t result) from them. As I get older, it occurs to me that there are times when I don&#8217;t want to have to be so strong. There are times when I really just want the biggest of hugs, or another human to have awareness of me needing support, even possibly when I do or cannot express it. On the flip side, an even deeper desire is to be the one that can give the support. \u00a0What many of us ask, is that\u00a0beyond friendships of convenience (like single serving airplane friends that will end when the flight is over) could there exist another person (robot?) that we\u00a0might stumble into, and give insight to answering this question about what components of interaction provide deeper meaning? I suspect the answer to that question will be different for each person. I also suspect that answering it will require more risk taking and sheer luck, and finally having an answer will coincide with\u00a0growing into a new level of\u00a0interpersonal maturity.<\/p>\n<h4>The\u00a0best strategy is probably maintaining openness to experience<\/h4>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know the answer to this question, and I&#8217;m not even sure how to figure it out. It&#8217;s pretty easy to address when introspection is involved. During my epic bike journey I thought over many experiences, and came to some basic conclusions that I needed to experience more things. In the case of people, other than going to a substantial number of social things, throwing away insecurity about talking to random people encountered in daily life, and in a romantic sense, going on an occasional date, there is no good way to &#8220;experience people.&#8221; Actually, the more salient factor here is control. With a search for meaning in the self, there is complete control over choosing experiences, deciding if they are liked, and then doing them. With people, even if the perfect other individual could be identified for a friend, housemate, or special life companion, there is no way to ensure that the liking would be mutual. It&#8217;s highly likely that it wouldn&#8217;t be. Most of the time some external life circumstances force interaction of people with one another, and further chance life circumstances, namely experiencing something that a second person also experiences, establishes special closeness. That makes it an even more impossible problem. Further, the common fear of vulnerability, tendency to not take risks, and easiness to let indecision guide decision (maintaining the status quot) means that answering this question has a large component that is chance. This subtly implies that there is no ideal strategy other than being open to experience, focusing on what gives meaning in the present, and letting probability do its thing. A third complicating factor is having an incentive structure that is not predictably average, and I am thinking of myself in this case. The first round of this &#8220;stumbling on happiness&#8221; introspection worked <em>so<\/em> well that I identified the little bits of things that gave me meaning, and now I find it hard to do anything else.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusions<\/h3>\n<p>I again have many questions and not a lot of good answers. Ironically, I read about 2\/3 of this book, got bored with the endless citations of &#8220;surprising&#8221; research, and still have not finished it. I suspect I will give it another try in 8 years! The problem is that, if we can break people into two groups: those that consume things, and those that produce them, my capacity for production of things far out-sprints my capacity to consume them. I don&#8217;t know how this is distributed in a normal population, but I&#8217;d guess given American culture that most are more heavy on the consumer side. In graduate school I have absorbed the belief that to be successful, I must err on the side of consumption with careful, targeted production. Thus, I live in constant angst that I am off balance, and try my every effort to resolve the weakness. \u00a0But it could be the case that being highly proficient in both (living in autarky) is an inefficient strategy, and that the ideal collaboration would involve specialization, meaning the pairing of a consumer and a producer. The consumer would absorb all of the knowledge and need that is currently represented, and communicate what is missing to the producer, who would then fulfill the need. It&#8217;s a lot harder to ask good questions than to generate an algorithm or tool to answer them. I do need to find a good consumer, because I&#8217;m sure there are answers out there to some of my questions if internal drive to produce could be slowed down in favor of consumption. Perhaps I can only conclude that reading might be highly dangerous for me, because it results in something longer than the pages themselves.<\/p>\n<p>On a more serious note, looking back on this experience,\u00a0a proper conclusion to this 8 year introspection must include an evaluation.\u00a0While sometimes it feels like it would be less of a burden to have the emotional depth of a goldfish, I find value in the possibility of being able to introspect, and instill change. \u00a0While these early experiences\u00a0(possibly) eliminated my capacity for deriving enjoyment from thinking about the future, they did alter my focus to direct, immediate actions and feelings, and over time that has instilled in me an almost stupid naivety and ability to derive joy from such trivial things. I plan my future in a way to maximize these momentary pleasures, which means avoiding airports, sitting in traffic, and post-office lines. It&#8217;s also lead to a (so far) bottomless well of motivation and drive that lacks any clear explanation for\u00a0existing at all. When self-doubt and obstacles knock, while there may be a time when the turkeys get me down, a strength comes forth that transforms frustration into empowerment, and I try again.<\/p>\n<p>One thing I am sure of, is that there are only about 3 hours left before I must bike home in the evening, and I really want to do some lovely producing! I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll stumble into interpersonal meaning, but for now I&#8217;m going to stumble back into syntax colored gedit where I like to be <img

She had lived there for two years, and never anything like this, until this single day when she had to say something. But how could she not? It was a feat of strength, and a struggle, every single time the key went into lock. It was a game of probability. There was a 0.3 probability that it would not turn the bolt to the left.

The second asking was rationalized with an abrasive comment about being short of hearing, but it was a passive aggressive statement that cut into her, sharp and suffocating as she imagined it would be for a sumo wrestler modeling an elastic bikini. Actually, about half of what the landlord said, the girl didn\u2019t understand at all. She was a petite Asian woman, fiery and commanding despite her small stature, usually dressed in a flowered shirt that was a cross between a nurse\u2019s scrub and a sweet smelling pajama. Her eyes were beady, so that there was no possible way to look deeply into them and infer if understanding or empathy was instilled. She had clearly worked hard her entire life, made no excuses, and demanded respect. But these qualities also made her extremely hard to read, meaning that trying to sift through her actions to uncover true intentions was about as easy as bringing a strainer to sand and maple syrup. A pancake of worry started to roll up in her mind. Was she not the ideal tenant she imagined herself to be? In the middle of the night she had taken to blending ice drinks to ward away the dank heat. She did not pay for utilities, but every so often turned on a fan hidden in the window to flush the hot air out of the apartment. She responded to a gas leak by not asking for replacement pipes, but by unplugging the stove and using it as a glorified laundry organizer. Finally, she regularly placed recyclables in the trash bin, mostly out of sheer laziness and a \u201ccollective action failure\u201d frame of mind that her single instances of defaulting on recycling wouldn\u2019t make any difference toward planetary well being. Recycling wouldn\u2019t have been so terrifying if the bins and dumpster didn\u2019t evoke the backyard scene from the 1990\u2019s movie \u201cThe Sandlot,\u201d the night-time smoothies wouldn\u2019t be necessary if she wasn\u2019t so darn thirsty all the time, and the fan wouldn\u2019t be needed if she wasn\u2019t so highly allergic to every airborne pollen, mold, and dust mite.

It was her neighbor across the street, an older Indian man, one that she had only seen briefly on walks, and he would always cross the street immediately to avoid the dire possibility of crossing within awkward feet of her on the same sidewalk. Or maybe it was her that did that. He seemed to have knocked at the door and was yelling at her, dressed in his usual faded blues, from across the street. How did he move so quickly? But then she woke up, and it was clear that her neighborly interaction was just the tail end of a dream. Her dreams were always vivid, visually more distinct than reality itself, and sometimes a more interesting place to be. It was immediately apparent that something was burning. She looked down at the mattress next to her hot pink pillow: her small space heater had fallen over and was face-planted on the mattress like a toddler that had fallen over and lacked the arm strength to do anything about it. She recovered him, Delonghi was his name, and was immediately grateful to her dream neighbor\u2019s warning. The last dream she had that related to real life was back when she was 8 years old. She dreamed of swimming in a green river, getting painfully bitten by an alligator-thing in the foot, and waking up immediately having fallen out of bed with a twisted ankle. At least this time she caught the hazard before Smokey the bear-thing showed up in her dream to roast marshmallows.\n\nIt was pitch black. Maybe she should make a smoothie, why was it so hot? The nightingale was still singing, maybe he wanted a smoothie too. She went to the bathroom quickly to resolve the prior two hours of waking up and drinking a small ocean, and then went to sit at her desk. Her mind was busy at work, and she tucked her knees up under her chin to support her massive head. And then she saw the spot on her left knee, just a hair and a freckle to the bottom right of her knee cap. Actually, a \u201cfreckle\u201d is quite the appropriate metric of distance, because this spot used to be one. And then possibly the world\u2019s first insight inspired by a freckle came to be. A cascade of warm, pink joy started to creep into her toes, all the way up to her knees, down again to her base, up through her torso, and then slipping out at the corners of her lips. The emergence of this smile was due to the realization that everything must change. Her angst wasn\u2019t about the lock, or the landlord, but the same fear of uncertainty and change that made her cling to routine. There was a certain comfort in knowing the intricacies and details of her world, a foundation made of smoke and glass. For 28 years she had garnished a birth mark in that spot. It was real, certain, tangible. Then one day, it was just gone, and as silly as it seems, she learned to appreciate her new knee without its identifying mark. Her knee spot formerly-known-as-freckle reminded her that tiny details were a form of mental blankie, providing comfort in not changing, but in reality being rather inconsequential. What is true for freckles is also true for more important things. Some amount of digital money that gets buzzed from one account to another, represented as a slightly different rendering of pixels on a screen, was exactly that. It could make her feel in or out of control depending on how she decided to feel about it. And thus we stumble on the strength that comes from making choices. She felt a sudden appreciation and understanding for her landlord, and for all the freckles that never were, and used to be.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Her landlord thought she was nuts.

Actually, a &#8220;freckle&#8221; is quite the appropriate metric of distance, because this spot used to be one. And then possibly the world&#8217;s first insight inspired by a freckle came to be. A cascade of warm, pink joy started to creep into her toes, all the way up to her knees, down again to her base, up through her torso, and then slipping out at the corners of her lips.  The emergence of this smile was due to the realization that everything must change. Her angst wasn&#8217;t about the lock, or the landlord, but the same fear of uncertainty and change that made her cling to routine. There was a certain comfort in knowing the intricacies and details of her world, a foundation made of smoke and glass. For 28 years she had garnished a birth mark in that spot. It was real, certain, tangible. Then one day, it was just gone, and as silly as it seems, she learned to appreciate her new knee without its identifying mark. Her knee spot formerly-known-as-freckle reminded her that tiny details were a form of mental blankie, providing comfort in not changing, but in reality being rather inconsequential. What is true for freckles is also true for more important things. Some amount of digital money that gets buzzed from one account to another, represented as a slightly different rendering of pixels on a screen, was exactly that. It could make her feel in or out of control depending on how she decided to feel about it. And thus we stumble on the strength that comes from making choices. She felt a sudden appreciation and understanding for her landlord, and for all the freckles that never were, and used to be.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 04:28:11 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 04:50:18 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 04:28:11 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1983,"title":"Flask Banner Image Application","slug":"flask-banner-image-application","markdown":"\nTwo interesting circumstances\u00a0combined today, and the result was a fun project\u00a0that, like most things that I produce, is entirely useless.

The fantasy had been imagined so many times, repeated indefinitely in his head, that the absence of the defining moment was as unacceptable as ripping a page out of a book. The back of his neck radiated heat, calling forth a cool, wet cloth that might provide temporary relief to his discomfort. They say that drinking hot liquid like tea actually serves to cool the body, but the thought of introducing more heat into the system seemed illogical and unsafe to him in that moment.\n\nFor all his successes, it was not enough. As a man, he was defined by his cleverness, ample responses when thinking on his feet, the momentary flash in his eye before responding to a challenge, and the mastery that was hidden in the s\u2019s that should have been z\u2019s in his words. It was not enough because the true strength of a man is not in the outside of a perception, but the inner workings, and coming to terms with the self without need for deception.\n\nHis heart felt like a tea bag immersed in a stew of hot water. It was filled with aromatic leaves and spice, and one would think they would escape when submersed in the first and last hot liquid that they would ever touch. But the translucent, slightly waxy white bag was a terrible lie. It puffed up like a white pressed shirt filled with air, giving subtle hint to the shadow and shape of the leaves inside, but barely a worthy taste or strength of the hidden potpourri could escape. And so it was submersed a second, a third, and another time, each instance a meek effort to release the pungent smelling spice. But too long in the bath only serves to wrinkle fingertips and diminishes the ability of the soapy water to bubble: the tea bag loses its strength and fades away. Or so we think, because no one really knows what happens to the true composition of the contents inside. But he knew exactly. The same was true of his heart. An external hope, an openness to expressing vulnerability and aching for the chance to send it off like a raft down a creek, and then following through, only served to build up more apprehension should that raft submerge and sink. The concentration of the outside steam was in complete, counter-intuitive opposition to the increase in intensity of that which remained inside. He would immerse himself entirely in just one more experience, a chance to finally give in completely to the surroundings, but each time the water was drank and he left slightly lesser than before.\n\nAnd so in times like these, he reached for something else in his pack, something that, rationally should counter such a herbal heat. He shouldn\u2019t have drank that soda, but it\u2019s bite was so sharp, so quick and intensely satisfying that it sent his teeth into a painful overdrive that shot up to the roots and climaxed into the most awful and wonderful of cold headaches. It was a shot that gave him a momentary high, and it brought him back to the memory he so yearned for in his time of thirst.\n\nThe mountain sky was blue, and then pink and red and purple, a distant painting to emphasize the impressive beast that it framed. He had touched that mountain in close detail. In the bitter cool morning the rock was unforgiving to his pleas and made each reach a calculated and unnerving risk. As it warmed in the rising sun, it promised him nothing but shadows, and greatness always one more peak away, if his bleeding hands could stand it and there was just enough powder left to cover his fingers like a powdered doughnut. At the crest of the day he made the final push, and then the mountain gave him everything, its most fantastic and shattering vulnerabilities all revealed at the sudden realization that there was no more vertical place to be reached and if there was a heaven this was truly it. Surrounding the thin and life-giving air was nothing but space and infinite time, and that is where he lost himself, and found an addictive warmth of awe, humility, and love. It was when the murkiness and stress of everyday life was lifted, to reveal his deepest thoughts and sequestered desires, when he tasted hints of meaning and purpose. And that\u2019s when he saw her. Those dark, compassionate eyes rendered in his soul. She was not bold enough to speak outwardly above the noise of the group, but her affection and concern for him was stronger than the loudest of voices. She gave him hope, filled him with sustenance, and a beautiful sonata that echoed in the crevices of the mountain. Her deepest insecurities, were beautiful to him. His most humanizing imperfections, she eroded away with a single wave of her joyful smile. In the portrait of that mountain was ingrained her presence, and he climbed it relentlessly in his mind looking for her likeness.\n\nThe summit was beautiful, but missing the realization of that which he longed for so deeply. He came back to the harsh reality of the evening train. The back of his neck was so hot. How could he be overheating in such a cool air? The car door opened, and he lifted inside his bike, a faithful companion yet disappointingly void in terms of conversation, and never expressing preference for Miso soup or dumplings. An ocean of tired faces lifted their bikes into the same car, and strangers equally monitored the stream looking for friend or companion. It was a long ride, and at every turn of a head with straight, dark hair, he hoped to see those soulful eyes peering out from a head caged in a bike helmet. It was never her. He didn\u2019t ache for yet another conversation about numbers or missing method, but just a companion to render the space around him safe and comforting, to combat the awful taste of too many people marinating in such a tiny space. He certainly did not need her to define him, or to give him focus to his work, but he didn\u2019t want to have to be so outwardly strong, and so caged all of the time. From the mountain to the setting suns that passed by the window day after day, his heart was filled with so much beauty that if he could not share it, he would surely explode.\n\nBut in the dawn of the moonlight this evening, he realized that he found his own heart in the mountain. It\u2019s majestic grace, character, and quiet wisdom had and would continue to give him peace. It was an unconditional love; it would not turn him away, it would give him air to counter the things that took it away from him. For so long he had selfishly looked for himself on those cliffs without giving back to the beast that guided his heart. An artist of movement and position, he had painted his story into the ledges time and time again, providing another layer to complement such a majestic portrait.\n\nAnd so, he brought her to the mountain, a gift to further complement this majestic portrait. The reds, pinks, and blues gave backdrop to not a single, but a group silhouette against the setting sun enveloping the lake. Warmed by a small fire and the sound of chopsticks, the mountain gazed at the creation that it had inspired. The momentary loneliness that comes with the dusk was returned to content, akin to the feeling of companionship that comes with reveling at existing in the same space as someone that you love. It is sometimes lonely to be a mountain, because it is expected to give itself to those that sacrifice themselves. But when the bravest of climbers see its true vulnerability, they bring their experiences to share with it. And the tea, shared by all, was fragrant, full bodied, and finally realized.\n\n\n","html":"<p>He had wanted it to be her.

At dinner parties there was never an empty plate, for parts of speech she brought eight. She carried with her a fountain pen, and painted the taverns and shops with a poetic zen. Her suffixes, whether a -lit or -ation, completed the prefixes that rushed out of the mouths of the people with confident start and lacking end. The tiny houses, one or two story, were ever so carefully framed with her guidance. If she tried to mediate a dilemma it was common knowledge to let her, because with every pro she brought a con, and for every right, she could present with a wrong. Her words were beautiful to see, her similie like a hot, body warming tea.\n\nThen one day, silence fell in love. He was so empty of meaning that Silence was drawn to smother him with everything that she might have. His jacket was the most beautiful, darkest of blues that she imagined it caused the purples, indigos, and violets that shared near on the rainbow to faint. His eyes read of nothing but were stained with a story of a million lifetimes. Somewhere in his jacket she imagined there to be a tiny pocket-watch where he kept all of time at a standstill. He was undefined, needing, and lost. His name was Sadness.\n\nTo his cold lips she lifted a warm cup of story, and hoped that it might flow life and joy into his tired veins. He tasted the broth, and pushed the cup away. She aired his dark cape in a lovely fragrence of pun and wildflowers, and he returned a cold, empty stare. Around his shoulders she put the blanket of a sonnet, her most powerful words paired in twos and threes, and his reponse was a mistrusting, flash of grimace, of seize.\n\nSadness\u2019 first response was with neutral melancholy, but soon he scratched away all formality and started to bear the turmoil he created inside himself. Silence wanted so badly to give him her words, but he ridiculed her. He brought out the demons that so haunted him and released the pain that he felt into her open heart. He captured her song with his fist, squeezed it until it trickled no more, and cast it across the room where it hit the wall, and crumpled to the floor. In her decades of life, the only thing she could bring to a fight was her word, and without her word she was as vulnerable as the empty lines that were missing it. Silence had tried, so hard, but Sadness could not bear to let her words give him sustenance.\n\nShe had nothing more to give him. Her words had failed her. Her eyes, reflecting the being across from her, were stained with Sadness. There was never a time when no gesture went without the beautiful song of Silence. There was never a moment when human thought or desire was left without a way to express it. This moment marked a change in the short, but ever-present human history. Silence had fallen in love, and fallen she would remain. The entire village too, was at a loss for words, and they would never recover from this new inability to not effortlessly express themselves.\n\nAnd now, Silence put down her pen, and for the first time, parted her lips, and there was truly nothing. The laughter of beauty receded into the tapestries, and the echos of hope hid behind the mountains. For the first time, the world heard the sound of silence, and it was heartbreaking.\n\n\n","html":"<p>There once was a small town in the province of Heschl, where there lived a young woman, Silence.

Her suffixes, whether a -lit or -ation, completed the prefixes that rushed out of the mouths of the people with confident start and lacking end. The tiny houses, one or two story, were ever so carefully framed with her guidance. If she tried to mediate a dilemma it was common knowledge to let her, because with every pro she brought a con, and for every right, she could present with a wrong. Her words were beautiful to see, her similie like a hot, body warming tea.<\/p>\n<p>Then one day, silence fell in love. He was so empty of meaning that Silence was drawn to smother him with everything that she might have. His jacket was the most beautiful, darkest of blues that she imagined it caused the purples, indigos, and violets that shared near on the rainbow to faint. His eyes read of nothing but were stained with a story of a million lifetimes. Somewhere in his jacket she imagined there to be a tiny pocket-watch where he kept all of time at a standstill. He was undefined, needing, and lost. His name was Sadness.<\/p>\n<p>To his cold lips she lifted a warm cup of story, and hoped that it might flow life and joy into his tired veins. He tasted the broth, and pushed the cup away. She aired his dark cape in a lovely fragrence of pun and wildflowers, and he returned a cold, empty stare. Around his shoulders she put the blanket of a sonnet, her most powerful words paired in twos and threes, and his reponse was a mistrusting, flash of grimace, of seize.<\/p>\n<p>Sadness&#8217; first response was with neutral melancholy, but soon he scratched away all formality and started to bear the turmoil he created inside himself. Silence wanted so badly to give him her words, but he ridiculed her. He brought out the demons that so haunted him and released the pain that he felt into her open heart. He captured her song with his fist, squeezed it until it trickled no more, and cast it across the room where it hit the wall, and crumpled to the floor. In her decades of life, the only thing she could bring to a fight was her word, and without her word she was as vulnerable as the empty lines that were missing it. Silence had tried, so hard, but Sadness could not bear to let her words give him sustenance.<\/p>\n<p>She had nothing more to give him. Her words had failed her. Her eyes, reflecting the being across from her, were stained with Sadness. There was never a time when no gesture went without the beautiful song of Silence. There was never a moment when human thought or desire was left without a way to express it. This moment marked a change in the short, but ever-present human history. Silence had fallen in love, and fallen she would remain. The entire village too, was at a loss for words, and they would never recover from this new inability to not effortlessly express themselves.<\/p>\n<p>And now, Silence put down her pen, and for the first time, parted her lips, and there was truly nothing. The laughter of beauty receded into the tapestries, and the echos of hope hid behind the mountains. For the first time, the world heard the sound of silence, and it was heartbreaking.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Thu, 06 Aug 2015 05:54:26 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 06 Aug 2015 06:05:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 06 Aug 2015 05:54:26 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":2008,"title":"Different","slug":"different","markdown":"\nIt was only when she was surrounded by others that she felt terribly alone. The floor was speckled with what must have been a mix of spilled alcohol combined with hot wing sauce taking a ride from table to bathroom on exhausted shoes. The standing tables with flowers were lovely, but out of place. The sitting tables, pushed together, were shaking and rumbling against the slam of finished glasses, orders being wrong or just plain forgotten, and garrulous laughter that, much of the time, might have been forced from a cohort of unwilling alveoli. And sitting at a table in the middle of it all, the tired girl was distracted by her inability to find the right place to put her feet. She was surrounded by people that she cared so deeply about, but somehow could not reach them through the blockade of noise. Her lovely new backpack, clean and black as a velveteen raven, waited patiently by the base of the chair, and she held her breath each time the rattled waitress scurried over with an ever-tilting, tiny striped tray with overfilled, dripping beers and martini glasses. She imagined the tray falling over, likely a regular occurrence for the pony-tailed waitress\u00a0bee, and a catastrophic outcome for the girl\u2019s collection of things that she carried with her.\n\nOnly when we leave the lovely place of our passions do we find things that we do not want to find. The girl lived primarily in a beautiful world inside of her head. In this place, she found happiness. She could someday master her domain, lead an army, inspire a heart, and it didn\u2019t matter if that domain, army, or heart lived entirely within herself. From a confusing, unidentifiable source she derived focus and drive toward solving tiny challenges, and solving these tiny challenges gave her meaning and emotional triumph. It was not something that needed attention or validation from any external source. She didn\u2019t care what she might be called, the amounts it would lead her to, or the next calendar event she was supposed to look forward to. If we might be given a running start to imagine the ideal version of ourselves at some future time, it\u2019s only a distraction from the reality that we are existing and full in the present. For the girl, this fullness was intoxicating. She was in a constant competition with herself, like a game of hide and seek where you are searching for the next version of your dreams across time. This intensity at various times in her life had been overwhelming, leading her to run across mountains, bike thousands of miles, and continue a search for solace in some yet-undiscovered alcove in her mind. But with much life experience comes knowing that the self is less an actual thing and more of a decision. The fun at the wedding party is not the shoes you put on but the feet that you put into them. The turkeys can only get you down if you offer yourself as doormat to their turkey feet. Her overwhelming intensity had matured and grown into an undying source of inspiration and happiness.\n\nBut this internal fire, like any source of warmth, was subject to the temperature around it. The external stimuli was too much for any of her tricks, and although she hadn\u2019t a clue what everyone was erupting about, the force of it brought her to respond with an equivalent forceful laugh, a response that was an effort to fight a current by swimming in the same direction. All of her efforts to sneak off into dreaming\u00a0about building elegant systems and tools were overpowered by such noise. She imagined that she might pull from her pocket a small packet of dust, and throw it into the air to cause a melodic pause, and tiptoe away to her bike parked outside. Was he still safely secured to the sign post? Do bikes get lonely? She imagined a world where bikes too would meet up to socialize after work, and decided that they would definitely go to pick up roller skates at a roller rink. In the world of transportation, love and companionship are shared by the common trait of having wheels.\n\nHer fantasy was interrupted at a question directed toward her. Why did she have to make a claim about things that she would want to do tomorrow if she loved the things that she did today? The arbitrage of external inputs made her feel washed away and empty. It was situations like these, being completely surrounded by people, when she felt completely isolated. It was times like these when loneliness grew in her heart because she suddenly felt out of place. It was moments as blurred and hazy as this evening hour when she realized that one of the things is not like the others, and she was not an others. And so she endured until she was certain that there could possibly be no more plates of tiny meat on sticks arriving at the table, and then she made her escape. It was with directed energy that she flowed through the back of the restaurant, as if guided by an invisible current from a deus ex machina. She felt relief and empowerment unlocking her bike, and feeling the force of the tires restored her to the lovely state of being in her own thoughts. She had felt this a thousand times before, and yet she still kept trying. It had come to her when she was a little girl, when she walked home in the setting sun after running practice in high school, and when she looked across the desolation of campus after the last day of classes\u00a0during University. It\u2019s common and normal to be different, but she had yet to meet another soul that she imagined felt as she did.\n\nBut something today was different. The growing loneliness, a gently spreading gray, was leaked into by a soft purple when she imagined him in her minds eye. It had been days since they walked together, and she wanted nothing more than to talk to him. The spending of a parcel of extra time without him felt like an opportunity cost, like choosing to not have ice cream when you really had wanted to try the coconut. He had a kindness, naivete, and quiet intellect that made him incredibly handsome and endearing, and she was sure that he didn\u2019t even know it. She had hugged him twice, even mustered up the courage to look him in the eye, and it made her feel comforted, safe, and understood. She wasn\u2019t even sure that her immediate family, let alone the rest of the world, understood what it was like inside her head, but she was convinced that he might. It was as if she had traveled thousands of miles, for decades, and found, for the first time, someone that brought color into the grays of being surrounded by social loneliness. People she had loved, in painful obvious and unrequited secret, had never loved her back, and yet her heart always seemed to return to an idealistic, childish hope to find such understanding. \u00a0And as she pedaled home, across the traffic, lights, and scurry of downtown, her mind erupted in beautiful, colorful\u00a0memory. If a moment in time can be like the beginning of a universe, the expansion had just begun.
