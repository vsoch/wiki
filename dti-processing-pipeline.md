 - [DTI Manual Processing](dti-manual-processing.md)  For processing in the SPM8 GUI in Matlab, you will need to download the Diffusion Toolbox 

## Cluster Processing

 - [DTI Cluster Processing](dti-cluster-processing.md) Includes a python, bash, and two matlab scripts to process DNS data with one or two DTI runs.  Requires that the python and bash script are saved in the same folder on your head node, and the MATLAB scripts are saved in the DNS/Scripts/SPM folder.
