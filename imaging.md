# Imaging

## Software and Tools

 - [SPM](spm.md) Statistical Parametric Mapping for different types of neuro data 
 - [FSL](fsl.md) A unix based tool for neuroimaging analysis 
 - [AFNI](afni.md) I've only used it for the AlphaSim tool 
 - [conn](conn.md) A toolbox for resting connectivity analysis based in MATLAB 
 - [xjView](xjview.md) A simple tool for displaying images and overlays  
 - [xvfb](xvfb.md) Allows sending graphical output to spot in memory, useful for graphical functionality in cluster environment 
 - [Rdgehdr](http://rsl.stanford.edu/research/software.html) Used to convert pfiles into text to read header info! 
 - [MRICron](http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron/install.html) a nice tool to have for looking quickly at data, and figuring out orientation.  It comes with a package called  - [dcm2nii](http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron/dcm2nii.html) that converts DICOM-->NIFTII as well.

## Data Preparation

 - [Quality Checking Tools](quality-checking-tools.md) 
 - [Neuroimaging Orientation](neuroimaging-orientation.md) 
 - [Voxel Value Matrix](voxel-value-matrix.md) Using a combination of scripts in Matlab, SPM, and bash to produce a matrix of raw activation values for each voxel from a functional set. 
 - [Running Scripts](running-scripts.md) Contains general information about running bash and python scripts on the cluster.
