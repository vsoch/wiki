# Classification Problem

**Classification Example**
Collect a dataset on breast cancer tumors, and collect data about properties of the tumor.  (For example. we might try to figure out if a tumor is malignant or benign based on the size of the tumor.)

Malignant or benign? (1 or 0) vs size of tumor

The variable that we are trying to predict is 0 or 1.  The x data (the size) could have more than one variable, perhaps we might look at age compared to tumor size, and malignant/benign status.  

**Support Vector Machines:** maps data to an infinite dimensional space and does classification using an infinite number of features.
