# Array Tomography Terms

[Colocalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colocalization): basically, the overlap between two or more markers 
[Deconvolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy#Deconvolution): When we use a microscope to take an image, we see little spots (puncta) of light, and these come off of the microscope at a particular resolution.  However, what we are imaging is actually smaller than any pixel that the microscope can image, and so we need deconvolution to better our resolution to more correctly reflect the structure that is smaller than the pixel.  For Array Tomography, the typical pixel size might be ~200nm, and after deconvolution that is improved to ~100nm.
