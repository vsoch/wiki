# Genetics

Plink is a handy command line tool for the quick analysis / filtering of large genetic datasets.  Since formatting data for input into Plink and formatting output from Plink for use with other analysis software can take lots of time, I've created some simple tools to help.

## Software

 - [Plink - Whole Data Genome Analysis Dataset](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/): Documentation and Official Site 

## Tools and Scripts

 - [Plink_View](plink-view.md): A MATLAB script that takes a .list file and optional lookup tables, and produces a formatted output .csv file 
 - [23andme to Plink](23andme-to-plink.md): A small pipeline for converting raw 23andme text data files into individual .ped/.map for use with Plink, as well as a .csv file for each person, and a master .ped/.map for all subjects.
