# Online Courses

## General Resources

 - [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/): The statistics and biology videos are spectacular, and each is relatively short, so it's easy to watch a few per day, and learn a lot over time without even realizing it! 
 - [Academic Earth](http://academicearth.org/):  The courses on here are a little static, but this is still a fantastic resource 
 - [MIT World](http://mitworld.mit.edu/browse): Has videos on every topic that you could imagine, spanning lectures, courses, and research talks. 
 - [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/): Inspiring, funny... on just about every topic you can imagine.  More for entertainment than learning 
 - [Keen Talks](http://keentalks.com/) A site that attempts to find the "good" videos on youtube.  Some good finds. 
 - [Google Course Builder](https://code.google.com/p/course-builder): When I want to distribute my own video content, I will likely start here. 

## Specific Courses

 - [STAT 202](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRsMEl6PHhM): I appreciated having this old version of the course while I was taking it, even if it was only the first half.
