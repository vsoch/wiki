This script is very simple.  It takes in a text file with a single list of subject IDs, and formats it for use in MATLAB as a variable.  I chose a single list text file, because it seems that it would be most probably to copy IDs from an excel or SPSS sheet. So if you had a text file with the following IDs:
<code batch>
11111_12345
22222_12345
33333_12345
</code>
You could make sure the script is located somewhere on your matlab path, and run the script by typing:
<code matlab>
matlab_id
</code>
and then select the text file, and the output in the window would be as follows, which you can copy paste into the command line to set the subjects variable!
<code matlab>
subnums={'11111_12345','22222_12345','33333_12345'}
</code>
If you want a slightly different formatting, you can just modify the script.  See the script [[http://www.vsoch.com/LONG/Vanessa/MATLAB/FormatID/matlab_ID.m|here]]
