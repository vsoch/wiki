=====General Resources=====
[[http://www.khanacademy.org/|Kahn Academy]]: The statistics and biology videos are spectacular, and each is relatively short, so it's easy to watch a few per day, and learn a lot over time without even realizing it! \\
[[http://academicearth.org/|Academic Earth]]:  The courses on here are a little static, but this is still a fantastic resource \\
[[http://mitworld.mit.edu/browse|MIT World]]: Has videos on every topic that you could imagine, spanning lectures, courses, and research talks. \\
[[http://www.ted.com/|TED Talks]]: Inspiring, funny... on just about every topic you can imagine.  More for entertainment than learning \\
[[http://keentalks.com/|Keen Talks]] A site that attempts to find the "good" videos on youtube.  Some good finds. \\
[[https://code.google.com/p/course-builder|Google Course Builder]]: When I want to distribute my own video content, I will likely start here. \\

=====Specific Courses=====
[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRsMEl6PHhM|STAT 202]]: I appreciated having this old version of the course while I was taking it, even if it was only the first half.
