=====General=====
[[Quality Analysis]]:  Use the QA tool to check raw functional or anatomical data for excessive motion, SNR, etc before any processing \\
[[Coverage Checking]]: Check coverage of individual subject data before setting up a group analysis \\

=====FSL Specific=====
[[ica_:melodic_dual_regression:#ica_package_contents|Melodic QA]] See melodic_qa for checking motion and rotation from MELODIC based on benchmarks \\
[[First Level FEAT Quality Check]] \\
[[Group FEAT Quality Checking ]] \\
[[Checking BET]] \\
[[Dicom to Nifti Checks]] \\

=====SPM Specific=====
[[SPM Quality Checks]] Before any fMRI data can be used beyond single subject processing, Quality Analysis needs to be conducted, which includes Checking BIAC QA and visually inspecting the data. \\
[[Fixing Timing Errors]] Instructions for manually re-doing the single subject analysis for a run that has errored timing AFTER the entire processing
pipeline has been completed.  In this case, we are fixing Cards. \\
