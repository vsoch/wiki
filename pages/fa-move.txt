Once DTI_fit has been run with Eddy Correction and we have a file called "DTI_FA.nii.gz" in the subjects DTI directory in the folder DTI, we need to move these particular files for all subjects relative to the experiment into the Analysis/DTI/FA folder to start running TBSS processing.  To do this, we use the following script, FA_move.sh.  You need to edit the script to include all of your subjects under the variable "Subjects" and you also need to make sure that the output directory exists (EXPERIMENT/Analysis/DESIGN_NAME/DTI/FA

To submit on command line:
<code bash>
qsub -v EXPERIMENT=FIGS.01  FA_move.sh     10
#                                          DTI FOLDER
</code>

=====THE SCRIPT=====
<code bash>
#!/bin/sh

#-------------FA_move.sh---------------------------------------
 
# This script takes the FA niftis produced by DTI.py, located in the subject's specified DTI folder in
# Data/SUBJECT/DTI_FOLDER/DTI, renames it to include the subject ID, and moves it to the Analysis/Faces/DTI/FA 
# folder for further procesing

# ---------WHEN DO I RUN THIS?------------
# In the pipeline, you should run this script after you have completed running fq.sh and want to
# compile your results in a single file for analysis

# --------WHAT DO I NEED TO CHANGE?------------
# the email to direct the successful run of the script
# You need to change the variable "Subjects to include all the subjects with a particular dti folder 
# 

#------------SUBMISSION ON COMMAND LINE---------------

# [abc1@head ~]$ qsub -v EXPERIMENT=Dummy.01 fq_read.sh   FACES      10        
#                                                        Design    DTI Folder
