#-------------TBSS_prestats.sh---------------------------------------

# This script must be run AFTER TBSS_postreg.sh is complete, This script 
# is the final step before voxelwise cross-subject analysis.  It thresholds
# the mean FA skeleton image at a chosen threshold, and results in a binary
# skeleton mask that defines the set of voxels used in subsequent processing.
# A "distance map" is created from the skeleton mask, and this is used in
# the projection of FA onto the skeleton.  The script then takes the 4D all_FA
# image (containing all subject data) and for each timepoint (subject ID)
# projects the FA data onto the mean FA skeleton.

# The script results in a standard-space version of each subject's FA image; 
# next these are all merged into a single 4D image file called all_FA, created 
# in a new subdirectory called stats. Next, the mean of all FA images is 
# created, called mean_FA, and this is then fed into the FA skeletonisation 
# program to create mean_FA_skeleton. This results in a 4D image file containing
# the projected skeletonised FA data for use in voxelwise statitics.


# --------WHAT DO I NEED TO CHANGE?------------
# the email to direct the successful run of the script
# You need to change the path to the folder with the DTI data
